                <s>Will it be credited by the youthful reader, that in this now free and happy land,
                    slaves were once bought and sold with as little remorse as cattle are in the
                    present day transferred from one master to another?</s>
                <s>Strange and revolting as it must appear to every lover of his country, such was
                    once the existing practice, not only in the remote ages, when the darkness of
                    heathen barbarism overshadowed the British islands, but even in the reign of the
                    benevolent and enlightened Alfred, under whose auspices law and justice were
                    established in form so pure and equitable, that many of his institutions have
                    been handed down to us from our ancestors as the noblest legacy in their power
                    to bestow.</s>

                <s>Civilization, it is true, made a great progress during the era of this
                    accomplished monarch, but he had so many difficulties to contend with, and so
                    many prejudices to overcome, that it is not to be wondered if some abuses remain
                    unreformed, and, among others, this inhuman traffic.</s>

            <p>
                <s>There were few occupiers of land in those days who were not possessed of thralls,
                    or domestic slaves, who were distinguished from the hired servants, by the
                    degrading badge of an iron collar, on which was inscribed the name of the
                    hapless bondman, with the notification that he was the purchased or the born
                    thrall, whichever it might happen to be, of such a person, of such a place.</s>

                    of this nature, is an illustrative sketch of the manners and customs of the
                    Anglo Saxons and Danes, during that glorious period of our annals, the age of
                    Alfred the Great, in whose reign its events took place.</s>

                <s>One bright autumnal morning, about eleven o'clock, the hour at which our Saxon
                    ancestors usually took their principal meal, just as the family and serving-folk
                    of the Saxon franklin,<gloss>A Saxon Freeholder, or gentleman, who was possessed

                    were seating themselves at the well covered board, a loud barking from the watch
                    dogs that guarded the homestead, answered by the low, but more angry, growling
                    of the household curs under the table, announced the approach of strangers.</s>

            <p>
                <s>Selwood, who was beginning to carve for his household, paused to listen, and
                    grasped his huge knife with a firmer hold, as though he meditated using it as a
                    weapon of defence in case of approaching danger.</s>
                <s>His serving-folk, who, according to the custom of those days, sat at the same
                    table with their master, but below the salt, started from their seats on the
                    rough oaken benches that surrounded the lower end of the board, and laid hand on
                    scythes, flails, or reaping hooks, exclaiming in alarm, <q who="text">The Danes

                <s>So contiguous indeed was the town of Whitingham, near which the farm and
                    homestead of Selwood were situated, to the Danelagh, or Danish colony that had
                    established itself in great power in Northumberland, that perpetual fear existed
                    in the minds of the franklin and his household, lest their dangerous neighbours
                    should at any time think proper to break the hollow truce then subsisting
                    between the Saxons and Danes, and pay him one of their predatory visits.</s>
            </p>
            <p>
                <s>The Danish settlements were, in fact, neither more nor less than so many
                    formidable hordes of rapacious banditti, always ready to give and take offence,
                    and on the look-out for plunder.</s>
                <s>They were a cruel, faithless race, in whose promises no reliance could be placed,
                    and whose only occupation consisted in rapine and deeds of blood.</s>
            </p>
            <p>
                <s>The industrious habits and peaceful employments of the Saxons, who having become
                    naturalized to the soil, had abandoned the warlike manners of their fierce
                    ancestors for the useful pursuits of the shepherd and the husbandman, were
                    sorely interrupted by the incursions and ravages of the <emph>black
                        strangers,</emph> as the invading Danes were emphatically styled, from the
                    sable hue of the vessels which brought this unwelcome swarm of northern robbers
                    to the shores of England, where they first arrived in the reign of Egbert, and
                    from that time contrived to obtain a footing in the country, and being yearly
                    reinforced with fresh bands of adventurers from the coasts of Denmark and
                    Norway, they continued to gain strength, and at length establishing themselves,
                    side by side as it were, by the Saxons, rendered themselves the terror of the
                    peacefully disposed, and the scourge of the whole country.</s>
                <s><q who="text">They are always before us,</q> says the Saxon Chronicler; <q

                        tramp of war.</q></s>
            </p>
            <p>
                <s>At the period of Alfred's accession to the throne, nine pitched battles were
                    fought in one year, between the English and the Danes, besides skirmishes and
                    private conflicts innumerable.</s>
                <s>Sometimes the Danes were defeated, but after each reverse they appeared to
                    redouble their activity, and actually increased in power.</s>
                <s><q who="text">If thirty thousand are slain in one day,</q> said the despairing
                    Saxons, <q who="text">there will be double that number in the field
                        to-morrow.</q></s>
                <s>Sometimes, when the Saxons found themselves unable to cope with their formidable
                    opponents, they were unwise enough to endeavour to purchase a shameful peace
                    with gold; but the bribe was no sooner in the possession of the greedy
                    barbarians, than they violated the dear-bought treaty, and committed all sorts
                    of violence, for the sake of extorting fresh sums of money.</s>
            </p>
            <p>
                <s>The appearance of a Danish holda, or chief, approaching the homestead of Selwood,
                    though only attended by a boy of tender years, who was leading a brace of
                    wolf-hounds in a leash, was sufficient to spread dismay through the
                    dwelling.</s>
            </p>
            <p>
                <s>There was an immediate consultation between Selwood and his wife, Winifred, as to
                    whether they should treat the unwelcome visitor as an enemy, by refusing him
                    admittance into the homestead, which doubtless he approached in the quality of a
                    spy, or, as he came in a peaceful guise, choose the alternative of conciliating
                    his friendship, by receiving him as a guest.</s>

                        deny him entrance,</q> said Selwood, <q who="text">albeit, I would with
                        greater pleasure invite a wolf to be my dinner-guest.</q></s>

                        trow,</q> said the careful Winifred, pocketing, as she spoke, the silver
                    ladle, with which she was preparing to help herself from the bowl of plum
                    porridge which stood before her.</s>
            </p>
            <p>
                <s>Swindedra, her niece, was in the very act of whisking away the porridge, also
                    muttering as she did so, <q who="text">that she had never taken the trouble of
                        compounding such a dainty dish to tickle the palate of a Danish raven, for
                        whom swine's flesh and barley broth were more than good enough,</q> when the
                    holda, whose quick eye had caught the manoeuvre as he entered, called out, <q

                        part of the cheer when a stranger surprises you at your meals? Now, that is
                        the very dish whereof I mean to eat.</q></s>
                <s>So saying, he snatched it from her hand, and placing himself in the seat of
                    honour at the table, he took a horn spoon from one of the serving men, and
                    devoured the contents in a trice, with the exception of a small portion, which
                    he left at the bottom of the vessel, and handed over his shoulder with a
                    patronizing air to his youthful atttendant, who stood behind his stool, still
                    holding the hounds in leash.</s>

            <p>
                <s>Guthred, for so the Danish chief called the boy, received this mark of favour
                    with a sullen and reluctant air, and maintained a proud, cold demeanour, to the
                    astonishment of the Saxon servants, who knew, from the iron collar, and other
                    unequivocal badges of slavery about his person, that the boy was in a more
                    degraded condition than themselves, being the purchased thrall or slave of
                    Ricsig the Dane.</s>
            </p>
            <p>
                <s>Riscig appeared by no means an unkind master, for he took some pains to supply
                    both the cravings of his hounds, and the probable wants of his young slave, with
                    the choisest provisions on the franklin's table, without paying the slightest
                    attention to the feelings of the indignant host and mortified household; but it
                    was thus that the insolent northmen conducted themselves when they entered the
                    dwellings of the peaceful Saxons, who very seldom ventured to remonstrate with
                    their unwelcome guests, lest they should draw upon themselves a still more
                    formidable visitation in the shape of fire and sword, taking it for granted,
                    that where one Dane made himself visible, ten more at least were lurking within
                    call, in readiness to espouse any quarrel in which he might involve himself.</s>
                <s>It was this apprehension that withheld Selwood and his men from expelling the
                    insolent intruder, who, after astonishing all parties with his voracity, laid
                    hands on a curiously carved drinking horn, which Swindreda, in her anxiety to
                    secure the plum porridge, had forgotten to remove, and calling for metheglin,
                    emptied and replenished it so often with this heady beverage, that he soon got
                    into high humour, and after bestowing great commendations on the beauty of the
                    horn, he, instead of taking possession of it by sticking it into his girdle,
                    beside his battle axe, as too many of his countrymen in such case would have
                    done, actually offered to purchase it of Selwood.</s>
