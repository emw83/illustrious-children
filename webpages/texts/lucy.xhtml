            <h1>Lady Lucy's Petition to the Queen</h1>
            <p>
                And is my dear papa shut up in this dismal
                        place to which you are
                        taking me, nurse?
                    asked the little
                    Lady Lucy Preston, raising her eyes fearfully to
                    the Tower of London, as the coach in which she was
                    seated with Amy
                        Gradwell, her nurse, drove under
                    the gateway.
            </p>
            <p>
                She trembled and hid her face in Amy's cloak,
                    when they alighted and she saw the soldiers on guard, with their crossed
                    partizans, before the portals of that part of the fortress where the prisoners
                    of state were
                    confined, and where her own father, Lord Preston, of whom she was
                    come to take a last farewell, then
                        lay, under sentence of death.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, my dear child,
                    returned
                    Amy, &gt;mournfully,
                        my lord, your father, is
                        indeed within these sad walls.
                        You are now going to visit
                        him. Shall you be afraid of entering the place, my dear?
            </p>
            <p>
                No,
                    replied
                    Lady Lucy, resolutely, I am not
                        afraid of going to anyplace where my
                        dear papa is. Yet she clung
                    closer to the arm of her attendant, as
                    they were
                    admitted within the gloomy precincts of the building; her little heart fluttered
                    fearfully as she glanced round her, and she whispered to the nurse, Was it not here that the young princes,
                        Edward the Fifth and his
                        brother Richard Duke of York, were
                        murdered by their cruel uncle Richard Duke of Gloucester?
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, my love, it was; but do not be
                        alarmed on that account, for no one will
                        harm you,
                    said old Amy, in an
                        encouraging tone.
            </p>
            <p>
                And was not good King Henry the Sixth murdered here also, by that same wicked Richard?
                    continued the little girl, whose imagination was full of the records of the deeds of blood that had
                    been
                    perpetrated in this fatally
                    celebrated place, many of which had
                    been
                    related to her by Bridget Oldworth, the housekeeper, since her
                    father had
                    been
                    imprisoned in the Tower on a charge of high treason.
            </p>
            <p>
                But do you think they will
                        murder papa, nurse?* 
                    pursued the child, as they began to ascend the
                    stairs leading to the apartment in which the unfortunate nobleman was
                    confined.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hush! hush! dear child; you must not talk of these things here,
                    said
                    Amy, or they will
                        shut us both up in a room with bars and
                        bolts, instead of admitting us to see my lord your father.
                    Lady Lucy
                    pressed
                    closer to her nurse's side, and was
                    silent till they were
                    ushered into the room where her father was
                    confined, when, forgetting every thing else in her joy at seeing him again, she sprang into his arms, and almost stifled him with her kisses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lord Preston
                    was
                    greatly
                    affected at the sight of his little daughter, and overcome by her passionate demonstrations of fondness and his own anguish at the
                    thought of his approaching separation
                    from her, and the idea of leaving her an
                    orphan at her tender age (for she had
                    only
                    just
                    completed her ninth year and had
                    lost her mother), he clasped her to his bosom, and bedewed her innocent face with his tears.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why do you cry, dear papa?
                    asked the little girl, who was herself weeping at the sight of
                    his distress. And why will you
                        not leave this gloomy place, and come home to your own hall again?
            </p>
            <p>
                Attend to me, Lucy, and
                        I will
                        tell you the cause of my grief,
                    said her father, seating the little girl on his knee. I shall never come
                        home again, for I have
                        been
                        condemned to die for high treason which means, an offence against the
                            king, and I shall not leave this place till they bring me forth on Tower Hill, where
                        they will
                        cut off my head with a sharp axe, and set it up afterwards over Temple Bar or London
                        Bridge.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this terrible intelligence, Lady Lucy
                    screamed
                    aloud, and hid her face in her father's bosom, which she wetted with her tears.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be
                        composed, my dear child,
                    said
                    Lord Preston, for I have much to say to you, and we may never meet again on this
                        side the grave, since I am so soon to die.
            </p>
            <p>
                No, no, dear papa,
                    cried
                    Lady Lucy, they shall not kill
                        you, for I will
                        cling so fast about your neck, that they shall not be able
                        to cut off your head; and I will
                        tell them all how good and kind you are, and then they will not want to kill you.
            </p>
            <p>
                My dearest love,
                        this is all simple talking,
                    said
                    Lord Preston; I have
                        offended against the law as it is at present established, by trying to have
                        King James, my old master, restored to the throne, and, therefore, I must
                        die. Do you not remember Lucy, I took you once to Whitehall, to see
                        King James, and how kindly he spoke
                        to you?
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, yes, papa! and I recollect
                        he laid his hand upon my head, and said, I was like what his daughter, the Princess of Orange, was at my age,
                    replied
                    Lady Lucy, with great animation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, my child, very
                        shortly after you saw
                        King James at Whitehall, the Prince of Orange
                            came over to England, and drove
                        King James out of his palace and kingdom, and
                        the people, who were
                        displeased with King James on account of his professing the Roman
                            Catholic religion, which they suspected he designed to re-establish in this country, deposed him, and made the Prince and Princess of Orange king and
                        queen in his stead.
            </p>
            <p>
                But was it not very
                        wicked of the Princess of Orange
                        to join with her husband to take her father's kingdom away from
                        him? I am
                        very
                        sorry
                        King James
                        thought me like her,
                    said
                    Lady Lucy, earnestly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hush, hush, my love; you must not talk so of the
                        Princess of Orange; for, perhaps, she considered she was
                        doing right in depriving her father of his dominions, because it
                            is against the law for a king of
                        England to be a Catholic. Yet, I confess, I did not believe
                        she would
                        have
                        consented to sign the death-warrants of so many of her father's
                            old servants, on account of
                        their faithful attachment to
                        him,
                    said
                    Lord Preston with a sigh.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have
                        heard that the Princess of Orange is of a merciful disposition,
                    said
                    old
                    Amy Gradwell, who had
                    been a weeping spectator of the scene between the father
                    and child;and perhaps she might
                        be
                        induced to spare your life, my lord, if your pardon were
                        very
                        earnestly
                        entreated of her by some of your
                        friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alas! my good
                        Amy, I have no one
                        who will
                        undertake the perilous office of soliciting the royal grace for an attainted traitor, lest they should
                        be
                        suspected of forwarding the cause of King
                            James,
                    said
                    Lord Preston
                    mournfully.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dear papa! let me go to the queen, and entreat
                        for your pardon,
                    cried
                    Lady Lucy, with a crimsoned cheek and sparkling eye. I will
                        so beg and pray her to spare your life that she will not
                            have the heart to deny me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Simple child!
                    exclaimed her father; what should you be able to say
                        to the queen that would
                        be of any avail?
            </p>
            <p>
                God would
                        teach me what to say,
                    returned
                    Lady Lucy
                    piously; and he has also power to touch her heart with pity for a child's distress,
                        and to open her ear to my earnest petition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her father clasped her to his bosom, but said, Thou wouldst
                        be afraid of speaking to the queen, even if thou shouldst
                        be
                        admitted to her presence, my Lucy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why should I be afraid of speaking to the queen, papa? for even if she should
                        be angry with me, and answer
                        harshly at first, I should
                        be
                        thinking too much of your peril to mind it. Or if she were to send me
                        to the Tower, and cutoff my head, she could
                        only
                        kill my body, you know; but would
                        have no power at all to hurt my soul, which is under the protection of One who is
                        greater than any king or queen
                        upon earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are right, my child,
                        to fear God, and to have no other fear,
                    said her father. It is He who hath perhaps put it into your
                            young heart to plead with the queen for my life, which if it be His pleasure that she should grant, I shall
                        feel it indeed a happiness for my child
                        to be
                        made the instrument of my deliverance
                        from the perils of death which now encompass me ; but if it should
                        be otherwise, His will be
                        done. He hath
                        promised to be a father to the fatherless, and he will not forsake my good and dutiful child when I am low in the dust.
            </p>
            <p>
                But how will my Lady Lucy
                        gain admittance to the queen's presence,
                        my Lord?
                    asked old Amy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will
                        write a letter to her godmother, the
                            Lady Clarendon, requesting her to accomplish the matter,
                    said
                    Lord Preston.
                He then wrote a few
                    hasty lines to that lady, which
                    together with his own petition for the royal mercy, he gave to his little daughter, telling her she was
                    to go the next day to Hampton Court,
                        properly attended, and to obtain a sight of Lady Clarendon, who was there in
                    waiting upon the queen, and to deliver that
                    letter to her with her own hand.
                He then kissed his child, tenderly
                    blessed her, and bade her farewell.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though the little girl wept much at parting with her father, she left the Tower with a far
                    more
                    composed mind than that with which
                    she entered it, for see 
                    had
                    formed her resolution, and her young heart was full of hope.
                She had
                    silently
                    committed her cause to God, and she trusted that He would
                    dispose the event prosperously for her.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next morning, before the lark had
                    sung her matins, Lady
                        Lucy
                    was up and dressed in a suit of deep mourning, which Amy
                    had
                    provided, considering it the most
                    suitable garb for a child whose only
                    surviving parent was under sentence of death.
            </p>
            <p>
                The servants, who had
                    been
                    informed of their young lady's intention to solicit the queen for her father's pardon, were all assembled in the entrance hall to see her depart, and as she passed through them, leaning on her nurse's arm, and attended by her father's confidential secretary and the old butler, they shed tears, and bade God bless her and prosper her in her pious design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lady Lucy arrived at Hampton Court, and was
                    introduced into the Countess of Clarendon's
                    apartment before her ladyship was out of bed
                    ; and having
                    told her artless tale with great earnestness, delivered her father's letter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lady Clarendon, who was wife to the queen's uncle, received her young god-daughter very
                    affectionately, but plainly
                    told her, she must not reckon on her influence
                    with the queen, because the Earl of Clarendon was in disgrace on account of being
                    suspected of carrying on a correspondence with King
                        James, his brother-in-law; therefore she dared not solicit
                    the queen on behalf of her friend Lord Preston,
                    against whom her majesty was so deeply
                    exasperated that she had
                    declared she would not show him any mercy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh!
                    said the little girl, if I could only
                        see the queen myself, I would not wish
                        any one to speak for me, for I should
                        plead so earnestly to her for my dear papa's life that she could not refuse
                        me, I am sure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Poor child!
                        what could you say to the queen?
                    asked the countess compassionately.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only let me see her, and you shall
                        hear,
                    said
                    Lady Lucy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, my love, it were
                        a pity but what thou shouldst
                        have an opportunity,
                    said
                    Lady Clarendon; but much
                        I fear thy little heart will
                        fail thee, when thou seest the queen face to face, and thou wilt not be able to utter a
                        syllable.
            </p>
            <p>
                God will
                        inspire me with courage, and direct the words of my lips,
                    said the little girl, with tears in her eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The countess was
                    impressed with the piety and filial tenderness of her young god-daughter, and she hastened to rise and dress, that she might, without further delay, conduct the child into the palace gallery, where the queen usually
                    passed an hour in walking, after her return
                    from chapel, which she attended
                    every morning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her majesty had not left the chapel when Lady
                        Clarendon and Lucy entered the
                    gallery, and her ladyship endeavoured to divert the anxious impatience of her little friend, by pointing out to her the portraits with which it was
                    adorned.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know that gentleman well,
                    said the child, pointing to a noble whole-length portrait of James the Second.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is the portrait
                        of the deposed
                        King James, Queen Mary's father,
                    observed the Countess, sighing, and a very
                        striking likeness it is of that unfortunate monarch; but hark! here comes the queen, with her chamberlain and ladies, from chapel, now,
                        Lucy, is the time! I will
                        step into the recess yonder; but you must
                        remain
                        alone standing where you are, and when her majesty approaches near enough, kneel down on one knee before her, and present your father's petition. She,
                        who walks a little in advance of the other ladies, is the queen. Be of good courage, and
                            address yourself to her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lady Clarendon then made a hasty
                    retreat. Lady Lucy's heart fluttered
                    violently when she found herself alone, but her resolution did not fail her; and
                    while her lips moved
                    silently in fervent prayer to the Almighty for his assistance in
                    this trying moment, she stood with folded hands, pale, but composed and motionless as a statue, awaiting the queen's approach; and when her
                    majesty drew near the spot, she advanced a step forward, knelt, and presented the petition.
            </p>
            <p>
                The extreme beauty of the child, her
                        deep mourning, the touching sadness of her look and
                    manner, and, above all, the fast
                    flowing tears which bedewed her innocent face, excited the queen's
                    attention and interest; she paused, spoke
                    kindly to her, and took the offered paper; but when she saw the
                    name of Lord Preston, her colour rose, she frowned,
                        cast the petition from her, and would
                    have
                    passed on, but Lucy, who had
                    watched her countenance with a degree of anxious interest that amounted to agony, losing all awe for royalty in her fears for her father's life, put forth her hand, and grasping the queen's robe, cried in an imploring tone, Spare
                        my father, my dear, dear father, royal lady!
            </p>
            <p>
                Lucy had
                    meant to say
                    many
                    persuasive things, but she forgot them all in her sore distress, and could
                    only
                    repeat the words, Mercy, mercy
                        for my father, gracious
                        queen! till her vehement
                    emotion choked her voice, and throwing her arms round the queen's knees, she leaned her head against her majesty's
                    person for support, while her rich
                    profusion of flaxen ringlets, which
                        partly
                    concealed her fair face, floated over the queen's dress; she sobbed aloud in the uncontrolable anguish of her heart.
            </p>
            <p>
                The intense sorrow of a child is always peculiarly
                    touching; but the circumstances under
                    which Lucy appeared
                    were more than commonly
                    affecting.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a daughter, not beyond the season of
                    infancy, overcoming the timidity of that tender age, to become a suppliant of an offended sovereign for the life of a father.
            </p>
            <p>
                Queen Mary
                    pitied the distress of the young petitioner; but as she considered the death of Lord Preston a measure of political
                    expediency, she told Lucy mildly, but firmly, that she could not grant her request.
            </p>
            <p>
                And will you kill my dear papa, who is so good and kind to every one?
                    said Lucy, raising her blue eyes, which
                        were
                    swimming in tears, to the face of the
                    queen.
            </p>
            <p>
                He may
                        be so, my child,
                    returned her majesty, but
                        he has
                        broken the laws of his country, and
                        therefore he must
                        die.
            </p>
            <p>
                But you can
                        pardon him if you choose to do
                        so, madam,
                    replied Lucy; and I have
                        read that God is
                        well
                        pleased with those who forgive, for he has
                        said, ' Blessed are the merciful, for they shall
                        obtain mercy.'
            </p>
            <p>
                It does not become a little girl like you to attempt
                        to instruct me,
                    replied the queen, gravely; I am
                        acquainted with my duty, and as it is my place to administer justice impartially, it is not possible for me to pardon your father, however painful it may be for me to deny the request of so dutiful a child.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lucy did not reply, she only
                    raised her streaming eyes, with an appealing look to the queen, and then turned them expressively on the portrait of King
                    James, opposite to which her majesty was
                    standing.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was something in that look which bore no ordinary meaning, and the queen, whose curiosity was
                    excited by the peculiar manner of the child, could not refrain
                    from asking her, wherefore she gazed so earnestly on that
                    picture?
            </p>
            <p>
                I was
                        thinking,
                    replied
                    Lady Lucy, how strange it was that you should
                        wish to kill my father, only
                        because he loved yours so faithfully.
            </p>
            <p>
                This wise, but artless reproof, from the lips of infant innocence, went to the heart of the queen.
                She raised her eyes to the once
                    dear and honoured countenance of a parent, who, whatever were his political errors as a king, had ever been the tenderest of fathers to her; and
                    when the remembrance that he was an exile in
                    a foreign land, relying on the bounty of strangers for his daily bread, while she and her
                    husband were
                    invested with the regal inheritance of which he had
                    been
                    deprived, pressed upon her mind, the thought of the contrast of her conduct as a
                    daughter, when compared with the filial piety of the child before her
                    (whom a sentence of hers was about to render an orphan), smote her heart, and she burst into tears.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rise, dear child,
                    said she. Thou hast
                        prevailed, thy father shall not die. I grant his pardon at thy entreaty, thy filial love has saved him.
            </p>
        
            <h1>Historical Summary</h1>
            <p>
                The conspiracy against the government of William the Third, and to effect the restoration of his exiled father-in-law, James the Second, for which
                        Lord Preston and his friend, Mr. Ashton, were
                    condemned to death, took place in 1692.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sir John Dalyrymple
                    relates the anecdote of the courageous child of Lord Preston, in his Memoirs.
                Ashton
                        was
                        put to death, but the presence of mind
                        of the young lady saved
                        Lord Preston's life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her name was
                    Catherine, and not Lucy.
                Her brother Edward
                    dying
                    young, she, with her two sisters, became her father's co-heiresses; at
                    seventeen she married a gallant
                    young nobleman, the son of Lord Widdrington, with whom she led a most
                    happy life.
                Her memory is
                    still
                    greatly
                    respected for her virtues and talents, in
                    Lancashire, her native county.
