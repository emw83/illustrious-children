            <h1>Guthred's Tale</h1>
            <p> Will it be credited by the youthful reader, that in this now free and happy land,
                slaves were once bought and sold with as little remorse as cattle are in the present
                day transferred from one master to another? Strange and revolting as it must appear
                to every lover of his country, such was once the existing practice, not only in the
                remote ages, when the darkness of heathen barbarism overshadowed the British
                islands, but even in the reign of the benevolent and enlightened Alfred, under whose
                auspices law and justice were established in form so pure and equitable, that many
                of his institutions have been handed down to us from our ancestors as the noblest
                legacy in their power to bestow. </p>
            <p> Civilization, it is true, made a great progress during the era of this accomplished
                monarch, but he had so many difficulties to contend with, and so many prejudices to
                overcome, that it is not to be wondered if some abuses remain unreformed, and, among
                others, this inhuman traffic. </p>
            <p> There were few occupiers of land in those days who were not possessed of thralls, or
                domestic slaves, who were distinguished from the hired servants, by the degrading
                badge of an iron collar, on which was inscribed the name of the hapless bondman,
                with the notification that he was the purchased or the born thrall, whichever it
                might happen to be, of such a person, of such a place. </p>
            <p> The tale I am about to relate, which is founded on an authentic historical fact of
                this nature, is an illustrative sketch of the manners and customs of the Anglo
                Saxons and Danes, during that glorious period of our annals, the age of Alfred the
                Great, in whose reign its events took place. </p>
            <p> One bright autumnal morning, about eleven o'clock, the hour at which our Saxon
                ancestors usually took their principal meal, just as the family and serving-folk of
                the Saxon franklin,A Saxon Freeholder, or gentleman, who possessed of one or more
                hydes of land. A hyde contains 100 acres. Selwood, were seating themselves at the
                well covered board, a loud barking from the watch dogs that guarded the homestead,
                answered by the low, but more angry, growling of the household curs under the table,
                announced the approach of strangers. </p>
            <p> Selwood, who was beginning to carve for his household, paused to listen, and grasped
                his huge knife with a firmer hold, as though he meditated using it as a weapon of
                defence in case of approaching danger. His serving-folk, who, according to the
                custom of those days, sat at the same table with their master, but below the salt,
                started from their seats on the rough oaken benches that surrounded the lower end of
                the board, and laid hand on scythes, flails, or reaping hooks, exclaiming in alarm,
                The Danes be upon us! </p>
            <p> So contiguous indeed was the town of Whitingham, near which the farm and homestead
                of Selwood were situated, to the Danelagh, or Danish colony thathadestablished
                itself in great power in Northumberland, that perpetual fear existed in the minds of
                the franklin and his household, lest their dangerous neighbours should at any time
                think proper to break the hollow truce then subsisting between the Saxons and Danes,
                and pay him one of their predatory visits. </p>
            <p> The Danish settlements were, in fact, neither more nor less than so many formidable
                hordes of rapacious banditti, always ready to give and take offence, and on the
                look-out for plunder. They were a cruel, faithless race, in whose promises no
                reliance could be placed, and whose only occupation consisted in rapine and deeds of
                blood. </p>
            <p> The industrious habits and peaceful employments of the Saxons, who having become
                naturalized to the soil,hadabandoned the warlike manners of their fierce ancestors
                for the useful pursuits of the shepherd and the husbandman, were sorely interrupted
                by the incursions and ravages of the black strangers, as the invading Danes were
                emphatically styled, from the sable hue of the vessels which brought this unwelcome
                swarm of northern robbers to the shores of England, where they first arrived in the
                reign of Egbert, and from that time contrived to obtain a footing in the country,
                and being yearly reinforced with fresh bands of adventurers from the coasts of
                Denmark and Norway, they continued to gain strength, and at length establishing
                themselves, side by side as it were, by the Saxons, rendered themselves the terror
                of the peacefully disposed, and the scourge of the whole country. They are always
                before us, says the Saxon Chronicler; we always see the horizon reddened with flame,
                we always hear the tramp of war. </p>
            <p> At the period of Alfred's accession to the throne, nine pitched battles were fought
                in one year, between the English and the Danes, besides skirmishes and private
                conflicts innumerable. Sometimes the Danes were defeated, but after each reverse
                they appeared to redouble their activity, and actually increased in power. If thirty
                thousand are slain in one day, said the despairing Saxons, there will be double that
                number in the field to-morrow. Sometimes, when the Saxons found themselves unable to
                cope with their formidable opponents, they were unwise enough to endeavour to
                purchase a shameful peace with gold; but the bribe was no sooner in the possession
                of the greedy barbarians, than they violated the dear-bought treaty, and committed
                all sorts of violence, for the sake of extorting fresh sums of money. </p>
            <p> The appearance of a Danish holda, or chief, approaching the homestead of Selwood,
                though only attended by a boy of tender years, who was leading a brace of
                wolf-hounds in a leash, was sufficient to spread dismay through the dwelling. </p>
            <p> There was an immediate consultation between Selwood and his wife, Winifred, as to
                whether they should treat the unwelcome visitor as an enemy, by refusing him
                admittance into the homestead, which doubtless he approached in the quality of a
                spy, or, as he came in a peaceful guise, choose the alternative of conciliating his
                friendship, by receiving him as a guest. He is a stranger, and as it is meal time it
                would be churlish to deny him entrance, said Selwood, albeit, I would with greater
                pleasure invite a wolf to be my dinner-guest. </p>
            <p> The wolf would be the less dangerous visitor of the two, I trow, said the careful
                Winifred, pocketing, as she spoke, the silver ladle, with which she was preparing to
                help herself from the bowl of plum porridge which stood before her. </p>
            <p> Swindedra, her niece, was in the very act of whisking away the porridge, also
                muttering as she did so, that shehadnever taken the trouble of compounding such a
                dainty dish to tickle the palate of a Danish raven, for whom swine's flesh and
                barley broth were more than good enough, when the holda, whose quick eyehadcaught
                the manoeuvre as he entered, called out, Holla there, maiden! is it your Saxon
                fashion to remove the best part of the cheer when a stranger surprises you at your
                meals? Now, that is the very dish whereof I mean to eat. So saying, he snatched it
                from her hand, and placing himself in the seat of honour at the table, he took a
                horn spoon from one of the serving men, and devoured the contents in a trice, with
                the exception of a small portion, which he left at the bottom of the vessel, and
                handed over his shoulder with a patronizing air to his youthful atttendant, who
                stood behind his stool, still holding the hounds in leash. </p>
            <p> Guthred, for so the Danish chief called the boy, received this mark of favour with a
                sullen and reluctant air, and maintained a proud, cold demeanour, to the
                astonishment of the Saxon servants, who knew, from the iron collar, and other
                unequivocal badges of slavery about his person, that the boy was in a more degraded
                condition than themselves, being the purchased thrall or slave of Ricsig the Dane. </p>
            <p> Riscig appeared by no means an unkind master, for he took some pains to supply both
                the cravings of his hounds, and the probable wants of his young slave, with the
                choisest provisions on the franklin's table, without paying the slightest attention
                to the feelings of the indignant host and mortified household; but it was thus that
                the insolent northmen conducted themselves when they entered the dwellings of the
                peaceful Saxons, who very seldom ventured to remonstrate with their unwelcome
                guests, lest they should draw upon themselves a still more formidable visitation in
                the shape of fire and sword, taking it for granted, that where one Dane made himself
                visible, ten more at least were lurking within call, in readiness to espouse any
                quarrel in which he might involve himself. It was this apprehension that withheld
                Selwood and his men from expelling the insolent intruder, who, after astonishing all
                parties with his voracity, laid hands on a curiously carved drinking horn, which
                Swindreda, in her anxiety to secure the plum porridge,hadforgotten to remove, and
                calling for metheglin, emptied and replenished it so often with this heady beverage,
                that he soon got into high humour, and after bestowing great commendations on the
                beauty of the horn, he, instead of taking possession of it by sticking it into his
                girdle, beside his battle axe, as too many of his countrymen in such case would have
                done, actually offered to purchase it of Selwood. </p>
            <p> It is the horn of my fathers, said the Saxon, and if I sell it to thee, it shall be
                for naught less than gold. </p>
            <p> Gold, echoed the Dane scornfully, dost think I am a Saxon monk, to carry coined
                pieces in my girdle? My wealth, added he, significantly grasping the handle of his
                battle axe, is in the purses of my enemies. </p>
            <p> That is to say, rejoined Selwood, that you mean to carry off my cunningly-wrought
                drinking horn, as a reward for my hospitality to thee and thy thrall. </p>
            <p> Said I not that I would purchase it of thee? demanded Ricsig. </p>
            <p> Ay, but what art thou willing to give me in exchange? said the franklin. </p>

            <p> Thou shalt choose, whether thou wilt have my hound, Snath; his fleet-footed
                companion, Wilbrach; or my thrall, Guthred, replied the holda; all three of these
                have displeased me this morning: the two first led me hither on a false track of
                deer, and the latter perversely refused to eat of the food which I flung to him even
                now from my own trencher; so choose between them, for the horn is now more precious
                in my sight than either. </p>
            <p> Selwood's judgment was assisted in making his election by a hint from the most
                prudent of housewives, the thrifty Winifred, who whispered in his ear, Curs have we
                more than plenty, master mind, for they only encourage the serving folk in idle
                pastimes, and serve as a cloak to conceal their wastery when the oaten cakes wax
                mouldy, or the meat is too fat for their liking: but we are in need of a boy to tend
                the swine and sheep, and to do many other things, so choose the young thrall, who is
                a stout healthy lad, and if discreetly trained, will do us worthy service both in
                and out of doors. </p>
            <p> No sooner had Selwood signified his choice to Ricsig, than the barter was completed
                by the Dane taking the boy by the collar, and transferring him to his new master in
                these words: </p>
            <p> I, Ricsig, give to thee, Selwood, Guthred my slave, to be thy thrall for ever. Then
                tucking the drinking horn into his belt, he strode out of the Saxon homestead,
                whistling to his dogs to follow. Guthred flung himself on the ground and wept. Nay,
                cheer up, my dainty bird, said Winifred compassionately, thou wilt have no cause to
                lament thy change of masters, I promise, if thou wilt be a dutiful and painstaking
                slave. </p>
            <p> Guthred redoubled his tears, and at length sobbed audibly. </p>
            <p> Thou didst not seem so loving to thy Danish master that thou shouldst bewail a
                separation from him thus passionately, observed Swindreda. </p>
            <p> Loving to him ! echoed the boy indignantly, his large dark eyes flashing through his
                streaming tears as he spoke, loving unto a Dane, to my born foe? </p>
            <p> Why then, thou shouldst rejoice in thy change of thraldom, said Winifred. </p>
            <p> It is for my thraldom that I weep, replied Guthred, for I was free born, and am no
                more disposed to serve a Saxon churl than to be the slave of a Danish robber. </p>
            <p> High words do oft proceed from an empty stomach, observed his new master, sternly;
                but I counsel thee, boy, to stint thy perverse prating, which can answer no other
                purpose than to bring the thong across thy shoulders. </p>
            <p> Thy women folk pestered me with questions, or I had only wept in silence, replied
                Guthred scornfully. </p>
            <p> Women folk, indeed! cried Swindreda, giving him a smart box on the years. I'll teach
                thee to use more respectful language of thy betters, and let thee know, withal, that
                it is not the business of a thrall to weep, but to work. </p>
            <p> It is well for thee that thou art a women, though an ill-favoured one, or I had
                returned thy hard blow with usury, retorted Guthred, clenching his hand. </p>
            <p> Swindreda was preparing to inflict summary vengeance on the imprudent railer, but
                Winifred humanely interposed to prevent the visitation of her wrathful displeasure,
                by sending her to feed the poultry, while she herself proceeded to instruct the
                newly-purchased slave in some of the household duties which he would be required to
                perform. </p>
            <p> On the following day, Selwood ordered his shepherd, his neatherd, swineherd, and
                wood cutter, to put him in the way of becoming a useful assistant in their several
                vocations, but Guthred was sullen and refractory with the men, and rebellious to the
                women; the authority of both was, of course, enforced by harsh measures, and the
                young thrall was compelled to yield reluctant obedience after repeated
                chastisements; thus entailing upon himself severe personal sufferings in addition to
                the hardships of servitude. </p>
            <p> His foreign accent and complexion, so different from that of his Saxon
                masters,hadobtained for Guthred the name of the Son of the stranger, a designation
                by no means likely to improve his condition among the Saxon serfs and ceorls, who
                had suffered too deeply from the aggressions of the Danes to be disposed to regard
                any foreigner with favourable eyes. Guthred was exposed to many taunts from the
                serving folk, on account of his persisting in wearing his dark hair, flowing on his
                shoulders, in its natural length, and rich luxuriance of spiral ringlets. Long hair
                was only worn by persons of noble or royal birth; and though Guthred had refused to
                declare his birth and lineage, he assumed this envied distinction, to the infinite
                displeasure of his associates in labour, who had more than once seized upon him,
                and, forcibly shorn these aristocratical honours from the proud head of the youthful
                slave; and when their mistress interposed her authority to prevent a repetition of
                the outrage, they vented their spleen in addressing him by the title of high and
                mighty thane, whenever they required him to perform the most servile offices. </p>
            <p> Guthred once smiled in scorn at the insult, and told his tormentors, that, like
                ignorant churls as they were, they addressed him by a title far below that which was
                his due. </p>
            <p> But this intimation drew upon him a torrent of such bitter mockery, that from that
                time forward he preserved a contemptuous silence when assailed by the taunts of the
                serfs. </p>
            <p> The long weary winter, the hardest time of bondage that Guthred had yet sustained,
                passed away, and the sweet season of spring once more clothed the Northumbrian
                fields with verdure, and enamelled the pastures with flowers. It was some relief to
                the persecuted thrall of Selwood, when he was separated from the rude churls, and
                employed in the solitary office of keeping the sheep on the extensive downs,
                heath-clad hills, or pleasant meads; but lovely as the scenes were, the sick heart
                of the young exile fondly yearned after the wild and rugged scenery of the far
                distant land of his fathers. Those eternal forests of sombre pines and chains of
                barren mountains, he preferred to the oaken glades, and the verdant hills and dales
                of the fertile island of the west, of which he had become an unwilling denizen. The
                land was indeed fair; but to him who has neither sympathies nor companionship, the
                most smiling landscape becomes a dreary desert. </p>
            <p> Had Guthred ever felt the divine influence of religion, he might have supported his
                early sorrows with resignation; for, though companionless, he would link known that
                he was not alone, that he was upheld by the everlasting arm of his Father and his
                God, and would have learned in every dispensation, however afflicting, to recognise
                his hand; but he had been born in a heathen land, and the light of Christianity had
                never dawned on his benighted mind. Selwood and his household, indeed, were,
                nominally speaking, Christians; but their creed and practice were so corrupted, and
                interwoven with pagan superstitions and idolatries, that they were scarcely in less
                darkness than the young heathen, whose aversion to their mode of worship excited
                their anger and contempt. </p>
            <p> Guthred only disliked their mode of worship because it was theirs, for he had never
                deigned to examine into the nature of their belief; from his own he drew no
                consolation; it was made up of shadowy recollections of gigantic idols, before whose
                images he had been taught by his father to bow the knee in the depth of gloomy
                groves. His remembrance recalled their terrific forms, but of their attributes he
                retained no idea, though he was occasionally wont to revoke them as the avengers of
                his wrongs, when injured by his Danish or Saxon task-masters. </p>
            <p> One day, when a war of words between him and Swindreda had ended in his stubborn
                refusal to draw water at her behest, and a severe corporeal punishment from the
                franklin had compelled him to submission, he proceeded to the sheepfold with a
                swelling heart, and throwing himself upon the ground, called aloud upon Thor and
                Woden to bring destruction upon Selwood and his whole household. </p>
            <p> He paused, partly exhausted by the violence of his transport of fury, and partly,
                perhaps, from a sort of undefined expectation of receiving an answer to his vengeful
                invocation. It came; but neither in the uproar of the elements, nor the rush of the
                chariot wheels of the destroyer careering through the air; but in the soft low voice
                of compassionate expostulation. He raised his face from the earth, and perceived a
                stranger beside him, whose majestic form and mild countenance impressed him with the
                idea that he was a being of a different order from the rude and savage men with whom
                he had been accustomed to associate. </p>
            <p> Unhappy boy! said the stranger, upon whom hast thou called? </p>
            <p> On the gods of my fathers, replied Guthred. Those whom mine own people worshipped
                within the strong circles of their power, and on whose rough-hewn altars my father
                was wont to pour forth the blood of his slaughtered foes. </p>
            <p> The stranger shuddered. Alas, poor child! said he, and canst thou believe that such
                inhuman sacrifices could be acceptable to the beneficent Creator of this beautiful
                world, which he has formed for the happiness and delight of his creatures, whom he
                has commanded to love one another, and to worship him in the beauty of holiness, not
                with polluted hands and bloody rites? </p>
            <p> Guthred looked perplexed, for the language of the stranger was incomprehensible to
                him. At length he said, It was to Thor and Woden these sacrifices were offered by my
                father. To them the savour of the blood is sweet; for they are called the Destroyer
                and the Avenger. Oh that they would bring fire and sword upon the homestead of
                Selwood, the Saxon! </p>
            <p> Thy guilty prayer is such as might indeed be expected from the lips of a benighted
                worshipper of the powers of evil, replied the stranger: but know, my son, that in
                offering homage to Thor and Woden you are acting in direct rebellion to the Lord and
                Giver of Life, and the Supreme Ruler of the Universe, and are provoking his wrath to
                visit you with those maledictions which you impiously call down upon your enemies. </p>
            <p> I cannot be more wretched than I am, replied Guthred, or suffer greater reverses,
                for I, who was born a prince, am now the slave of slaves. He bowed his face once
                more upon the earth, and lifting up his voice, wept aloud. </p>
            <p> The stranger allowed his passionate grief to vent itself, without interruption, for
                some moments, and then drawing Guthred to him, he addressed him in words of sympathy
                and encouragement. </p>
            <p> The soothing tones, and language of compassion and tenderness, were new to the ears
                of the youthful slave; but they made their way to his heart, and melted the obdurate
                pride which had always prompted him to oppose violence to violence, and to return
                wrong for wrong, and with the confiding frankness of childhood, he flung himself
                into the arms of his unknowna comforter, and wetted his bosom with his tears. </p>
            <p> You say you were born a prince, observed the stranger, after a pause. Whence come
                you? </p>
            <p> From the land of the dark forest and the snowclad mountain, replied Guthred, with a
                flushing cheek and kindling eye, from Lethra,Lethra, a province of ancient Sweden.
                Palgrave. where my father, Hardacanute, was a king and a warrior: and I, his heir,
                was brought up on the knees of the valiant, served by the hands of the noble, and
                lulled to sleep by the songs of the bards, who told of the deeds of my great
                forefather, the mighty Odin, whose coal-black eye, and raven hair, they said
                resembled mine. But Halfdane and Hubba, the fierce sons of Regner Lodbrok, came,
                like a wintry torrent, spreading woe and desolation through my native Lethra, and
                having slain my sire, and burned his cities, they bore me, a helpless sorrowing
                child, from the place of my birth, and the kingdom I should have inherited, to their
                own detested land of Denmark, where Halfdane, the eldest of the fierce brethren, the
                same who now awes the trembling Northumbrian Saxons, with the terror of his name,
                this Halfdane, I say, exchanged me with his hunting companion, Ricsig, for a
                wolf-hound, and Ricsig, in his turn, trucked me away to Selwood, the Saxon, for a
                paltry drinking horn, as though I had been a thing of nought, a senseless utensil,
                or a beast of the field. </p>
            <p> And how have you been treated in the household of the Saxon franklin? demanded the
                stranger. </p>
            <p> With hard words and harder blows, returned Guthred, indignantly, have I been driven
                forth to the performance of vile offices. A hewer of wood and a drawer of water have
                I been to sordid household queens, and a drudge in field and fold to the base churls
                who served my Saxon master, and with their injurious usage increased the bitterness
                of a prince's bondage. Pity have I had from no one save from thyself, added he, in a
                softened tone, on perceiving the kindly drops which the tale of his sorrows had
                drawn from the benign eyes of the stranger. And who art thou that weepest for the
                woes of an alien and a slave? Surely thou belongest not to the race of the unfeeling
                Saxon, or the savage Dane! </p>
            <p> My name is Eadred, replied the stranger, and, though of Saxon lineage, I am not, I
                trust, unfeeling, but the servant of One who is the friend of the friendless; who
                hath, in his Divine wisdom, for some good purpose, doubtless, brought thee hither,
                and hath sent me to thee with tidings of comfort. </p>
            <p> In reply to Guthred's eager inquiries, Eadred proceeded to reveal to him that God,
                of whose name and attributes he had hitherto remained in profound ignorance. </p>
            <p> Guthred listened patiently, for the manners of the eloquent speaker had that mild
                persuasive charm which appeals resistlessly to every heart. He listened attentively,
                for the subject was one of powerful interest, conveyed as it was, in the impressive,
                but sublime simplicity of truth. He listened with delight, for the pure doctrines of
                Christianity were glad tidings to the desolate, heartbroken captive, to whom they
                offered better hopes of happiness in a future state of existence than the savage
                pleasure of quaffing mead and beer from the skulls of slaughtered foes, in the
                joyless valhalla, or heaven, of Scandinavian mythology ; and Guthred, the lineal
                descendant of the renowned Odin, who was honoured as one of the mightiest of the
                northern divinities, became a convert to the Christian faith. </p>
            <p> Eadred frequently sought his young friend in the lonely pastures where he kept the
                franklin's sheep, for the purpose of imparting to his powerful, but uncultivated
                mind, the advantages of that learning which he was ably qualified to communicate;
                for Eadred was a Saxon monk of distinguished talents and eminent acquirements, who
                resided in a neighbouring convent, and employed himself in works of mercy and
                charity, and experienced a pure delight in diffusing the light of knowledge and
                religion, in succouring the distrest, and comforting the sorrowful. As his pupil,
                the hitherto fierce and intractable Guthred, became mild, reflective, and
                intelligent, the hours that he had been accustomed to waste in vain repining,
                listless inanity, or stormy bursts of passion, were now employed in study or
                heavenward meditation, which enabled him to correct the defects of his character,
                and to endure with resignation and fortitude the toil and persecution he
                occasionally had to bear. He no longer regretted the loss of power and dominions,
                for his mind was to him a kingdom, and the intercourse he enjoyed with the pious and
                accomplished Eadred, he would not have resigned for all the riches the world could
                bestow. </p>
            <p> Books were then rare possessions, confined to the libraries of convents, and but
                seldom to be met with in the cabinets of monarchs, yet Guthred, through the favour
                of his learned friend, was seldom without a roll of illuminated MS. in his bosom
                wherewith to beguile his solitary hours, and sweeten the labours of the day. Nor
                were his studies confined to book-learning alone; he became an observer of the face
                of nature, and the characters of his fellow men. </p>
            <p> Knowledge is power, Lord Bacon, in later times, has said, and the enslaved Guthred,
                the servant of servants, as he, in the bitterness of his soul had aptly styled
                himself, acquired with his growing wisdom such influence over the minds of those
                around him, that he became as it were the oracle of the household and neighbourhood.
                His sayings were quoted, his advice solicited, and his judgment appealed to, in all
                cases where parties were at issue or difficulties occurred. </p>
            <p> Like the captive Hebrew in the house of the Egyptian lord, every thing appeared to
                prosper with him. The flocks and herds of Selwood increased, and his crops were more
                abundant; plenty was without, and peace was within the dwelling, where the master
                mind of the young slave, as he approached to manhood, manifested its superiority
                over the ignorant serfs and ceorls, by the improvements he suggested, and the good
                order he contributed to establish and maintain. But these days of tranquillity were
                not to last. The growing wealth of Selwood excited the cupidity of the Danish hordes
                in the neighbourhood, who, taking advantage of a dispute among themselves, in which
                they pretended that the inhabitants of Whitingham had interfered, poured down upon
                the devoted Saxons, plundered their dwellings, drove away their flocks and herds,
                and put every man to the sword who dared to offer resistance to their lawless
                rapacity. </p>
            <p> When Guthred, who had been sent by his master on a message of trust, to receive a
                sum of money from the monks of Lindisfairne, for a drove of fat bullocks, returned
                to Whitingham, he found the lands harried, the flocks and herds gone, and his
                mistress sitting on her ruined hearth-stone, weeping over the mangled corse of the
                murdered franklin, her husband; deserted by serfs and thralls, they having taken
                advantage of her calamity to provide for their own interests; and even abandoned by
                her niece and sole relative, Swindreda, that damsel having taken a fancy to one of
                the Danish plunderers, with whom she departed to the Danelagh. </p>
            <p> It was then that Guthred found occasion for the exercise of those principles of
                Christian benevolence, which had been inculcated by the pious Eadred. That beloved
                friend was indeed lost to him, for the conventhad been plundered and burned by the
                ferocious Danes, and no trace of the monks or their peaceful and useful occupations
                remained; but the precepts of Eadred remained indelibly impressed on tablets of
                Guthred's heart, whose first impulse was to bestow such consolation and assistance
                as it was in his power to offer to the broken-hearted widow. </p>
            <p> Poor Winifred, whohad not expected to receive that sympathy and succour from the
                foreign thrall whichhadbeen denied by those from whom shehad most reason to expect
                it, lifted up her voice, and blessed him with the blessing of the widow and the
                destitute. </p>
            <p> When Guthredhad consigned the bleeding remains of his murdered master to a grave,
                which he dug for him beneath the umbrage of one of the noble elms thathad formerly
                overshadowed the low roofed but pleasant dwelling, he conducted his sorrowing
                mistress to a miserable shieling, or cottage, thathad escaped the general
                conflagration thathad consumed house, barns, and cattle sheds; but, notwithstanding
                all his care and consideration, Winifred must have perished of want,hadit not been
                for the sum which Guthredhad received from the monks of Lindisfairne for his
                deceased master, and which he now, with scrupulous fidelity, delivered to the
                astonished widow. Keep it, my son, said she, and use it for our mutual benefit;
                surely it will be safer in thy hands than in mine, and will prosper under thy
                management. </p>
            <p> Guthred applied this little store with such prudence and success, and used such
                unremitting personal exertions, in improving the widow's mite, that, by degrees, her
                desolate dwelling began to wear an air of comfort, and at length she found herself
                the mistress of a productive little farm, with kine, sheep, swine, and poultry,
                sufficient for her use. </p>
            <p> Guthred, who found a sweet satisfaction in administering to her comforts, was repaid
                a thousand fold by the tender affection with which he was regarded by the grateful
                widow, who was to him as a mother. </p>
            <p> Northumbria continued the theatre of petty intestine wars, not only between its
                rival population of Saxons and Danes, but of fierce dissensions among the Danes
                themselves, who, since the death of Halfdane, their leader, and the overthrow and
                slaughter of his brother Hubba (the sons of Begner Lodbrok, and chief governors of
                the Danelagh),had not been able to agree among themselves respecting the choice of a
                successor to the sovereign authority, not one of the royal line of Odin remaining
                among their hordes. </p>
            <p> But the wars and rumours of wars, which spread desolation, bloodshed, and terror,
                through country and town of this unfortunate district, disquieted not the humble
                cottage where the widowed Winifred and her thrall, Guthred, found shelter and
                contentment. There were moments, perhaps, when Guthred felt disposed to regret that
                his talents and acquirementshadno nobler sphere for their exercise than the
                occupations of a shepherd or husbandman; but then the reflection that he was engaged
                in the virtuous performance of the duties of that state to which ithad pleased his
                heavenly Father to call him, checked the rebellious suggestions of ambition and
                discontent, and he returned to his toils with the pious conviction, that if it were
                the will of God that the hand that ought to have wielded a sceptre should be doomed
                to guide a plough in an obscure corner of a foreign land, it was right that it
                should be so. But other things were in store for the royal orphan, whohadbeen
                prepared and fitted in the school of adversity for a better inheritance than that
                which was his birthright. </p>
            <p> One morning, on returning from the field to breakfast, he found Winifred attired in
                her best black kirtle, surcoat, and hood, and busily engaged in smoothing, with an
                iron, the plaits and coarse embroidery on the back and shoulder of his sabbath
                supertunic, which garment was made of coarse home-spun white linen, precisely
                similar in all respects to the long open frocks worn in the present day by
                waggoners. How now, my good mother, said Guthred, with a smile, for by that
                endearing title he had long been accustomed to address her, what makes you so full
                of business with my best parelling to-day? To-morrow is neither Sunday nor a saint's
                day, you know. </p>
            <p> No matter, my son, replied Winifred, there is to be a goodly show and a great
                festival at Oswindune, for the Danes and Saxons are tired of their quarrels and evil
                doing, and have resolved to choose a king of Northumberland by mutual agreement,
                this blessed day, to put an end to bloodshed and deadly debate; and Ulph, the
                miller, of Whitingham, who hath just told me the glad tidings, hath promised to lend
                us one of his grist carts, and the old pied mare, that we may go thither like our
                neighbours to view the joyful sight. </p>
            <p> My dear mother, said Guthred, those will be wisest who keep at home on such a day,
                especially women folk and Saxons, believe me; for such a meeting is far more likely
                to create deadly debate than to end them, and then the sword and the battleaxe will
                be the umpires that will decide any quarrel that may arise; for as to the Danes and
                Saxons agreeing in any thing, much less on a matter of such importance as the choice
                of a king, it is not to be expected ; therefore, their assembly will only be the
                cause of bloodshed, so, dear mother, be persuaded by me, and go not thither to-day. </p>
            <p> Nay! nay ! my son, thou art, for once, mistaken in thy judgment, said Winifred, for
                our people and the Danes have already agreed in the wise determination of leaving
                the nomination of their mutual governor to our good king Alfred and the pious bishop
                of Lindisfairne, who will both be present, they say; and if we go not to Oswindune
                to-day, we may never again enjoy the felicity of looking upon such a king and such a
                prelate. Besides, added she, on observing that Guthred was about to offer some fresh
                objection, I am resolved on going, whether you approve of it or not; for I have
                lived under the shadow of this poor shieling in the depth of a wood, lo! this seven
                years, and seen neither feast nor festival since the day of my sad widowhood, and
                'tis time now, I wot, that I should enjoy some pastime; so, if thou likest not to
                drive the pied mare, I will e'n ask Ulph the miller to give me a seat in his great
                meal waggon, with the rest of the gossips and neighbours, who are going to see this
                blessed sight. </p>
            <p> Well, mother, replied Guthred, if you are thus bent on going, I am your thrall, you
                know, and bound to do your bidding; and even were that not the case, I would attend
                you for love's sake, especially as there may be danger. </p>
            <p> Winifred, in high good humour at having carried her point, packed up a store of
                oaten cakes, cheese, and dried mutton, to which she added a bottle of her best
                metheglin, as a store for the journey, while Guthred combed his long dark ringlets,
                washed his face and hands, and donned his snowy super-tunic and fox-fur cap, in
                readiness to attend his mistress. </p>
            <p> The roads were like all roads in those days, of a very rough description, full of
                deep ruts and holes, here and there mended with rough blocks of stone, or the trunks
                of trees laid side by side. The grist cart was an uncouth, and what was worse, a
                jolting conveyance, and the miller's old pied mare a sorry jade; nevertheless, the
                day was so fine, and they met with such abundance of good company on the road, that
                both mistress and slave were in the best possible spirits, and were willing to
                overlook all inconveniences, and only to dwell on the agreeable part of the journey. </p>
            <p> When they drew near the scene of action, Winifred was greatly amused by examining
                the various cavalcades of Danish holdas in their burnished armour, over which flowed
                silken mantles, and their long red tresses braided with gems and threads of gold,
                for the Danes, notwithstanding their ferocious and barbarous manners, affected great
                nicety in dress, and were the fops of the ninth century; the gallantly armed and
                mounted Saxon thanes, with their courtly yet warlike bearing, and festal array, each
                attended by a train of martial followers; the bands of wealthy franklins, and sturdy
                ceorls, with their wives and families; even the poor serfs and craftsmen of low
                degree were flocking from all directions to the spot. Besides these were glee men
                and harps; travelling jugglers with apes and bears; morrice dancers; and itinerants
                of various descriptions, with their tempting wares, mingling in the motley groups. </p>
            <p> The simple Winifred, whohad never seen half so many grand people in the whole course
                of her life, was, in her ecstasies, ready to leap out of the grist cart with delight
                one moment, and the next inclined to rate the prudent Guthred soundly, for having
                endeavoured to prevent her from enjoying the pleasure of so brave a spectacle. </p>
            <p> All is well that ends well, was his only reply to her reproaches. </p>
            <p> All must end well that hath so joyous a beginning, cried Winifred, for lo! how
                lovingly are the Danish holdas riding with our noble thanes, and their grim
                spearsmen behave like brethren to the ceorls and milk maidens. Oh, it was never so
                seen in my time! or my poor dear Selwood had not been barbarously slain, only for
                withstanding the foul robbers from plundering his homestead! but the Lord hath
                turned their wolfish hearts since then, I trow! </p>
            <p> Or rather, the victorous arm of our noble Alfred hath taught them the necessity of
                adopting better manners, rejoined Guthred smiling. The Saxon hath the best of it
                now, good mother, or the Daneshad never consented to adopt a king of his choosing;
                but the truth of it is, Alfred's valour and Alfred's wisdom have so completely
                broken the power of the Danelagh, that their leaders are happy to accede to any
                terms he may choose to impose, as a condition of being allowed to remain in
                possession of the lands they have acquired in Northumbria. </p>
            <p> When they arrived at Oswindune, Winifred expressed an earnest desire to obtain a
                sight of the holy bishop of Lindisfairne; but, as he was surrounded by Saxon thanes
                and Danish chiefs, with whom he was discussing the important business on which this
                assembly had been convened, there would have been little chance of her wish being
                gratified,had it not been for the impertinence of the jester of a Danish holda, who,
                perceiving that his master was exceedingly amused at poor Winifred's equipage,
                maliciously rattled his bauble about the ears of the pied mare, which so terrified
                the animal, that, becoming perfectly unmanageable, she started off at headlong
                speed, and in spite of all Guthred's efforts to restrain her, carried the grist
                cart, with himself and Winifred, into the very centre of the privileged circle that
                surrounded the bishop of Lindisfairne. </p>
            <p> The arrival of this unexpected addition to the national council appeared so
                thoroughly ludicrous to all parties, that Saxons and Danes alike indulged in the
                most immoderate bursts of laughter, while some of the younger of both nations were
                found sufficiently illmannered and undignified as to make sport for their
                companions, by scornfully calling their attention to the long tresses, indicative of
                high rank, which Guthred wore flowing over the coarse array of a peasant, and which
                ill assorted with the badge of thraldom on his neck. Others still more annoying,
                drew near, and goaded the startled mare on every side. Guthred on this, perceiving
                that his mistress's personal safety was greatly imperilled, by the kicking and
                plunging of the terrified animal, sprang from the cart, and seizing the head rein,
                attempted to lead the mare out of the press. The rude chiefs closed round about the
                cart, to prevent the escape of the objects of their amusement. </p>
            <p> Guthred on this, mildly, but boldly, addressed himself to both Saxons and Danes,
                requesting them to desist from tormenting the mare; for, said he, the poor animal
                will receive some injury, and although she be a sorry beast, it behoves us to be
                careful of her, for, my masters, she is a borrowed one. </p>
            <p> This explanation was received with noisy shouts of mirth, the annoyances were
                redoubled on every side, while both Saxons and Danes bade Guthred stand back, and
                not presume to interrupt their pastime. </p>
            <p> Guthred boldly maintained his ground, and brandishing his oaken quarter-staff,
                avowed his intention of defending his mistress and the miller's mare from all
                aggressions. </p>
            <p> The imperious nobles of both nations were astonished and enraged at the hardihood
                displayed by a peasant's thrall, in daring singly to resist the will of powerful
                chiefs and magnates; and a gigantic holda, whose mature years and high rank ought to
                have restrained him from engaging in such proceedings, was preparing to deal the
                dauntless Guthred a blow with the heavy handle of his battleaxe, which must have
                prostrated him, had not Winifred, who perceived his intention, and recognised his
                person at the same moment, called out, It doth ill become thee to pay in such base
                coin, methinks, for the plum porridge and metheglin with which thou wert feasted at
                the board of my husband, Selwood. </p>
            <p> Just ten years agone, good wife, I think, returned Ricsig (for it was no other). I
                remember thee now by the token of that shrill voice of thine, and for the sake of
                the excellent plum porridge and metheglin whereof thou speak est, the like of which
                I have not tasted since, I will now stand thy friend, and help thee and thy son to a
                place whence thou mayest see the bishop, and hear him speak. </p>
            <p> Winifred was profuse in her acknowledgments to the holda; but, with the pride that
                formed a prominent part of her character, she thought proper to inform him that the
                young man was not her son, but her thrall; The very lad, pursued she, whom you gave
                to my poor dear husband, Selwood, for his carved ivory drinking horn. </p>
            <p> Notwithstanding all Guthred's magnanimity and acquired philosophy, he felt mortified
                at the feeling of littleness in his mistress, which prompted her to make this
                communication to the holda; and he thought from the eager manner in which his former
                master turned about and scrutinized him from head to foot, that it was more than
                probable he might think proper to reclaim him. But Ricsig, clapping his hands
                together, shouted in a loud voice, He is found, Bishop! the lost son of Hardacanute,
                the last of the god-like race of Odin, the king whom you have named and we have
                chosen, is here! Behold, ye valiant Danes, the dark eyes and raven hair of the royal
                line of the 'king of men,' whose descendants alone are meet to sway a Danish
                sceptre. Lo! Ricsig, the son of Kingvar, is the first to bow the knee before him in
                homage. </p>
            <p> The bishop of Lindisfairne, at these words, descended from the rude episcopal
                throne, whichhadbeen raised for him on the green turf, and, revealing to the
                astonished eyes of Guthred the dearly loved and unforgotten features of his friend
                and instructor, Eadred, folded him to his bosom for a moment; then, amidst the
                mingling acclamations of Saxons and Danes, conducted him to the summit of the hill
                of Oswindune, where the royal inaugurations of the Northumbrian monarchs always took
                place, and pouring the consecrated oil on his head, exchanged the iron badge of
                thraldom for the golden bracelets and circlet of royalty, and presented him to the
                mixed multitude of Northumbrian Danes and Saxons as their king. </p>
            <p> To the enfranchised slave, so lately the sport of adverse fortune, this sudden
                elevation appeared like a strange dream; but when he was admitted into the presence
                of the royal Alfred, to swear the oath of fealty to him as his liege lord, he
                learned from his lips that he had been long marked by him to fill the vassal throne
                of Northumbria on the recommendation of his friend and counsellor, the bishop of
                Lindisfairne, who had educated and (unknown to himself) fitted him for the discharge
                of royal duties, while he wore the iron badge of servitude. Nor did Guthred, when
                intrusted with the awful responsibility of despotic power, prove unworthy of the
                confidence reposed in him. The illustrious Alfred found in him a faithful friend,
                and an able coadjutor in establishing equitable laws, reforming abuses, and
                diffusing the pure light of Christianity through a semi-barbarous land, and
                introducing the refinements and virtues of civilization among the rugged race over,
                which he reigned, in peace and prosperity, during many years. </p>
            <p> Guthred's first exercise of regal authority was to raise his friend and instructor,
                Eadred, to the bishopric of Durham, which he richly endowed; nor was he forgetful of
                his old mistress, Winifred, whom he cherished with the greatest tenderness, and
                watched over her declining years with the dutiful affection of a son. </p>

            <h1>Historical Summary</h1>
            <p> Those who have not examined the map of that part of Great Britain which formed the
                Anglo Saxon empire, will be astonished to find, how large and important a portion of
                our island was once designated by the name of Northumberland. Children cast their
                eyes on the map, and see our northernmost county, or the land lying between the Tyne
                and the Tweed, at present so called, and must necessarily form a very inadequate
                idea of the power of the Saxon Northumbrian king; especially when they find from
                history that this sovereignty had two divisions, the north was called the Kingdom of
                Bernicia, and the south that of Deira. It is requisite to explain, that the ancientM
                North Humber Land literally meant all the land lying north of the river Humber ; and
                the possessions of the monarchs of this district comprised the whole of the great
                county of York, Durham, and not only the spot now corruptly called Northumberland,
                but Roxburghshire, Lothianshire, and the north-eastern counties of Scotland as far
                as the Frith of Forth, and as much further as the strong hand of violence could
                grasp and retain. Edinburgh, or Edwinsborough, was then a city and a fortress
                belonging to the Saxons, founded by one of their chiefs. </p>
            <p> A further examination of the map of Europe will shew the youthful student how
                conveniently Northumbria, with her noble ports and rivers, and her long line of
                coast washed by the German Ocean, was to the piratical rovers that swarmed into
                England from Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and the north of Germany. These were
                collectively first called Saxons, then Danes, and afterwards Normans, who
                successively supplanted each other and were originally the inhabitants of the shores
                of the Baltic and North Sea. At the era of the tale of Guthred, or the Widow's
                Slave, the kingdom of Northumberland was the strong hold of the Danelagh, or Danish
                invaders, from whence they harassed the rest of the island. Another glance on the
                map of our country will shew our juvenile reader how strongly fortified by nature
                Northumbria was bounded on the north by the Frith or Forth; on the west by the chain
                of mountainous hills that divide the six northern counties; and on the south by the
                great estuary of the Humber, which is the receptacle of the Trent, with her thirty
                arms to the south ; and many fine rivers on the north, that traverse Yorkshire, the
                Alde, the Swale, the Wharfe, the two Dons, and their dependencies. We may aptly
                compare the figure of the Humber on the map to the thick trunk of an oak tree, with
                its numerous branches; and the mischievous influence of the Danes may be imagined,
                when we remember that they were able to navigate these rivers in their flatbottomed
                boats, and by these means pierce into the heart of South Britain. </p>
            <p> Guthred is an historical character, and the Saxon annals thus relate his adventures.
                After the death of Halfdane, the Host of Danes, who had conquered Northumbria,
                remained without a leader. The Northmen were much at variance among themselves.
                Several years before, the sons of Regner Lodbrok had seized upon Guthred, the son of
                Hardacanute, the king of Lethra, in Sweden; they sold him as a slave or thrall, and
                in 803 he was the property of an old widow in Northumberland. Guthred's lineage was
                known, he was marked as one of the royal race, and he was raised to the supreme
                authority in a very singular manner. Eadred, Bishop of Lindisfairne, acting, as it
                was said, under the direction of St. Cuthbert, whohadappeared to him in a dream,
                proceeded to the host of the Danes, and persuaded them, as well as the Saxons, to
                accept Guthred as their sovereign. He was conducted to Oswin's Dune, or the hill of
                Oswin, and invested with the golden bracelets, the ensigns of royal dignity, and
                solemnly inaugurated as king of the Northumbrians, though in vassalage to Alfred the
                Great as his superior. Guthred was deeply indebted to Bishop Eadred, and he paid his
                debt of gratitude by granting and confirming, not only the lands between the Tyne
                and Wear, but the royal dominion over all between the Tyne and Tees, now of the
                county of Durham. Alfred assented to this donation; for he saw the great advantage
                that would result to his country, from the wild forests of that district being
                reclaimed by the peaceful monks. From this grant the palatinate rights of the
                wealthy bishops of Durham arise, and which are still retained, in a great measure,
                in the present day. The bishop was a prince between the Tyne and Tees. He could
                pardon and condemn, and even exercise the power of life and death; and for this
                reason, a bishop of Durham may, if he please, sit on the bench in scarlet robes when
                the judges try a criminal within his diocese. </p>
            <p> We must not omit to mention that Guthred ever remained faithful to Alfred. </p>
            <p> The ready election of this prince by his former enemies, the Danes, as well as the
                Saxons, may be accounted for, by the reverence in which the royal line of Sweden was
                held throughout the north as the genuine descendants of Odin, who was the reformer,
                conqueror, and lawgiver, of the north, and for several ages worshipped as a god. He
                was said to be of Asiatic origin, and the dark hair and eyes that tradition decribes
                his descendants to have possessed, makes that idea probable. </p>
            <p> In such respect was a king of Sweden held in ancient times, on account of his lineal
                descent from this mighty ruler of the north, that the rival monarchs of Denmark and
                Norway condescended to hold his bridle and stirrup when he mounted or dismounted, on
                solemn occasions, when these princes met. </p>
