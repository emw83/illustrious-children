            <h1>The Royal Chase of Wareham</h1>
            <p>
                On the death of Edgar the Second, sirnamed the
                    peaceable, England was
                    distracted by the contentions of two
                        adverse factions respecting the
                    choice of a successor to the crown.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the head of the most powerful party, distinguished by the name of the
                    Dunstanites, was the famous
                    Archbishop Dunstan,Some account of
                        this celebrated statesman and ecclesiastic will be found in the Historical
                        Summary. who supported the title
                    of Edward the Atheling, or prince royal, the eldest son of the deceased monarch, by his first wife.
                The other faction called the Anti-Dunstanites, were the partisans of the queen dowager, the beautiful but wicked
                    Elfrida, who was
                    ambitious of placing her young son Ethelred on the throne, and
                        governing in his name during a long minority.
                But while the whole nation was divided and
                    involved in civil discord on this point, and the most deadly hatred agitated the minds of those who espoused the rival claims of the sons of Edgar, it is an interesting fact that the youthful princes, though only brothers by the half blood, were united in the tenderest bonds of love.
            </p>
            <p>
                Edward, who had
                    just
                    completed his fourteenth year, had
                    been
                    named by his dying father as his successor.
                The right of primogeniture was his also, and
                    in the Witenagemot or great national council, the eloquence and influence of the two archbishops, Dunstan and Oswald, obtained a formal recognition of those
                    rights, and Prince Edward
                    was, in conformity with the will of his deceased father, placed on the throne of the Anglo Saxons.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the tender age of seven years the
                        baleful passions of ambition had no place in the then guileless heart of the younger prince.
                Unconscious of the charms of royalty, of which he had as yet only
                    experienced the restraints, the loss of a
                    kingdom was not to him matter of either
                    disappointment or regret.
                The only sorrow of which the decision of
                    the Witenagemot was productive to him was his separation from that beloved elder brother, in whose affectionate bosom he had, from his earliest remembrance, been wont to repose
                    his childish joys and griefs, and who
                        had
                    been his companion, his guide, and his own
                    sweet familiar friend.
                Never were the soothing kindness and fond endearments he had
                    been accustomed to receive from the princely
                    Edward so much required by Ethelred as at this period, when all the evil passions of his haughty mother's nature had
                    been roused and called into baleful activity during her late
                    attempts to supplant her royal step-son: and having been foiled in her endeavours to usurp the royal authority in Ethelred's name, she vented her
                    mortification and baffled rage on the
                        unfortunate object of her maternal ambition and defeated
                    machinations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Weak in body and feeble in mind, Ethelred had evidently been
                    designed by nature for a private station, and these constitutional defects
                    frequently subjected him to the bitterest reproaches and most injurious treatment from the imperious
                    Elfrida, whose unrestrained violence of temper rendered her at all
                    times an object of terror to him, although occasionally experiencing the most pernicious indulgence from her when caprice inclined her to fondness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Child as he was, Ethelred
                    was
                    only too painfully
                    aware of the evil traits of his mother's character, and since he
                        had
                    been
                    deprived by death of his natural protector, and afterwards separated from his affectionate brother, he seemed to tremble
                    at the sound of her step, and sought at all
                    times to avoid her presence, while he beheld with jealous displeasure the caresses she bestowed on her little cankered dwarf Wulstan,
                    whose droll tricks and impish mischief occasionally
                    possessed the power of diverting the black gloom that oppressed her,
                    after she had
                    been
                    compelled to resign the gaiety and splendour of the court for a solitary residence in Corfe Castle,
                    one of the royal demesnes in Dorsetshire, which had
                    been the favourite hunting palace of her late husband King Edgar, who had
                    been
                    accustomed to spend much of his time there; and thither Elfrida
                    had
                    been
                    allowed by her generous step-son to retire, with her son Prince Ethelred
                    and a train suitable to the dignity of his father's widow.
                Instead of being
                    moved by the kindness and forbearance of the young
                    king, Elfrida
                    continued in secret her treasonable practices against him.
                She had
                    already
                    sacrificed her first husband Ethelbald to her ambition, and she only
                    waited a suitable opportunity of attemping the life of Edward.
                The Archbishop Dunstan
                    was, however, fully
                    aware of her cruel and perfidious disposition, and he strictly
                    guarded his royal pupil from all her
                    machinations and conspiracies against his person, and warned him perpetually against the imprudence of either admitting her
                    to visit the court, or trusting himself in the vicinity of her abode.
                So implicitly
                    had the cautions of Dunstan
                    been
                    attended to by those about the young king, that for a period of
                    three years he had
                    been
                    prevented from holding the slightest intercourse with Elfrida and her son.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the affectionate heart of Edward
                    yearned towards his younger brother, whom he earnestly
                    desired to embrace once more.
                The cares of royalty, the sceptre of a divided realm, and the severe restraints and self-sacrifices imposed upon him by his austere but faithful guardian Dunstan, were
                    grevious to the youthful monarch, who, in addition to these, was
                    compelled to submit to the stern
                    discipline of a monastic education;
                    and the mode in which learning was
                    communicated in those days was equally fatiguing to the preceptor and painful to the pupil.
                Elementary books were not then written to facilitate the progress of education.
                There were not above three copies of a meagre dictionary in existence in
                    England, and lessons were
                    learned from dictation, till, by frequent
                    repetition the student committed them to memory, or, according to the ancient phrase, "got them by
                    heart."
            </p>
            <p>
                These impositions were
                    distasteful to the young king, and were often sadly
                    contrasted by him with the pleasures and joyous freedom of his early years,
                    before his accession to the regal
                    dignity had
                    burdened him with the heavy fetters of state and deprived him of the amusements of his age, and above
                    all of the company of his brother Ethelred,
                    his tenderly-beloved
                    living plaything.
            </p>
            <p>
                The royal manor and castle of Corfe had
                    been, as I said before, the favourite
                    residence of the deceased king his
                    father, during whose reign it had
                    been a constant scene of gaiety and festivity.
                The happy days of Edward's childhood had
                    been
                    spent there, and when he compared the gloomy routine and fatiguing
                    employments of his present mode of life with the sweet remembrances of that pleasant time, he felt
                    disposed to regard the demesne of the queen dowager as a sort of
                    Eden, contrasted with which the rest of his
                    kingdom was but an extensive wilderness.
            </p>
            <p>
                This desire of revisiting the scenes of his
                    infancy, "his home," as he emphatically styled Corfe Castle, became more pressing in proportion as it was
                    resisted by his inexorable guardian and the rest of the wise counsellors by whose decision
                    he, while a minor, was
                    compelled to abide, and he secretly
                    resolved to embrace the first opportunity that might occur for the gratification of
                    his wish.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meantime, unremitting application to
                    the laborious studies and public
                    duties which Dunstan
                    enjoined, impatience of the restraints imposed upon him, and above all, his incessant
                    pining for the beloved scenes and companion of his childhood, produced a visible change in his health.
                His fading cheek, heavy eye, and languid appearance, at length attracted the attention of Dunstan, who, in common with most ecclesiastics of that period, possessed a considerable knowledge of physic, and was
                    desirous of administering to his royal pupil a medicine which he considered might be efficacious to him.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is of no avail," said
                        Edward, rejecting as he spoke the proffered cup, "it is not a nauseous compound of drugs that will restore me to health. It is the devertisements, the relaxations, and the
                        companionships of my age that I require.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Know you not, Oh!
                        King, that as the lord of a mighty nation, you are
                        called upon to put away childish things, and to employ
                        your precious time in fitting yourself for the performance of the important duties which pertain to your exalted station?"
                    said the archbishop.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Ah! station full of sorrow!" exclaimed the young king, "how gladly would I exchange
                        its gilded fetters for the healthful toils and envied freedom of a shepherd
                        boy!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "In the same sinful spirit of discontent and rebellion against the dispensations
                        of the Most High, thou wouldst
                        have
                        coveted
                        regal dignity, hadst thou been
                        doomed to bear the hardships and privations of a herdsman's
                        lot,"
                    replied the archbishop.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I could
                        endure them all patiently, yea joyfully, were I permitted to breathe the fresh
                        free air of dale and down in
                        liberty," rejoined the youthful monarch, "and to solace myself with the company of one
                            dear
                        familiar friend, were it but a day."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Thou art a perverse boy, and knowest not the value of a real friend when thou hast found one,"
                    said
                    Dunstan
                    reproachfully.
                "Thou deemest me harsh, and my counsels bitter, because, instead of dissembling with thy folly, I labour to convince thee that a king is the property of the nation that permits his authority, and that it behoves him to sacrifice his dearest
                        wishes where they interfere with the duty
                        he owes to his people."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Nay, but, my father," said
                        Edward, "my present desire is so simple in its nature, that it concerneth no one beside myself, or I would not urge it."
            </p>
            <p>
                "It is, I know, of no avail to reason with thy perversity to-day,"
                    said
                    Dunstan
                    impatiently.
                "What wouldst
                        thou?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I would
                        fain hunt the deer in my royal chase of
                        Wareham,"
                    replied the king in a hurried voice, being
                    awed by the stern manner of his preceptor into dissembling half
                    his wish.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Is that all?" demanded
                        Dunstan, fixing his penetrating eye upon the varying cheek of the youthful king; "thou mightest
                        well call thine a simple wish, and if thou hadst
                        added
                        foolish thou hadst not said
                        amiss."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I knew thou wouldst
                        call it so, my Lord Archbishop,"
                    said the king, turning away.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Nay, Edward, nay,
                        this is mere childishness," resumed the archbishop, taking the feverish hand of his royal charge, "if hunting the deer be thy desire, far be it from
                        me to withstand thee in such a trifle,
                            especially as thou thinkest the fresh air and jocund exercise of following the hound horn will
                        restore thy health and spirits; but why
                            shouldst thou speak of the distant woods of Wareham for thy divertisement, when thou hast thy royal and wide extended forest and chase of Waltham so close to thy loving city of London, that thou
                            mayest
                        enjoy
                        goodly pastime there this very
                        day, with thy noble thanes, and
                        earldormen and trusty burgesses
                        for thy company and guards?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "No," replied the king,
                        "I love not to seek my game amidst such gaping crowds of idle followers, and I will not hunt at
                        Waltham to-day."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Thou shalt
                        find
                        goodly sport in the fair forests of Windsor, if thou
                            wilt
                        seek it there," said
                        Dunstan, "or in thy chase at Sheen, or
                        at Greenwich and the Black-heath."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I do not incline to hunt
                        at Windsor," replied the King, "nor yet
                        at Sheen, nor Greenwich, nor the Black-heath, nor any where but at Wareham,
                        where my royal father was
                        wont to rouse the deer."
            </p>

                "Wareham is too
                        near to Corfe Castle, the abode of the bold
                        bad woman, thy guileful stepdame Elfrida,"
                    replied
                    Dunstan.
                "It is a vicinity
                            fraught with peril to thee,
                        and thou shalt not go thither, Edward."
            </p>
            <p>
                Edward
                    was
                    sad and sullen during the remainder of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next morning there was an evident access of the low fever that hung about the young king; he was
                    languid and dispirited, and would neither attend to his
                    studies, nor enter into any of the little plans laid out for his amusement by his courtiers at Dunstan's instigation.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Dunstan
                    perceived this, and observed that his royal pupil sickened and rejected his food from
                    day to day, he said to him again, "Edward, what wouldst thou?"
            </p>
            <p>
                "I told thee before,"
                            replied the youth, "but it was in vain, that I did but desire to
                            breathe the sweet air of the Dorsetshire hills and downs,
                        and to hunt the deer in my pleasant woods of Wareham, and
                        lo! thou didst
                        refuse me this little thing."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Because I saw
                        thou wert like a foolish bird, wilfully
                        bent on falling into the snare of the cunning fowler," returned
                        Dunstan, "and I know thou hast now
                            only
                        revealed a part of thy purpose, which is to visit Corfe Castle."
            </p>
            <p>
                A deep blush overspread the pale cheek of the young
                    king, as he protested that he had no such intention.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I fear thou dost
                        dissemble with thy true friend, King
                            Edward,"
                    said the archbishop.
                "In troth, my son, it is
                        only
                        natural that thou shouldst
                        desire to embrace thy brother Ethelred;
                        but, give up this wild whim of thine, and I will
                        send for the young prince to London when a convenient season shall
                        befall."
            </p>
            <p>
                A feeling of false shame withheld the king from acknowledging that he had not dealt
                    candidly in the matter, and he redoubled his protestations that his whole
                    desire was simply to spend a few days in hunting the game in Wareham forest, which he prayed the archbishop not to deny him.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Thou shalt go," said
                        Dunstan after a long pause, "but on
                        condition that thou dost not visit Corfe Castle, nor hold any intercourse with the Queen Elfrida, nor any of her
                        people."
            </p>
            <p>
                Edward
                    accepted the terms, but in the secret hope that accident would
                    bring him to a sight of his brother without
                    a direct violation of his promise.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The word of a king ought to be an obligation more
                            sacred than the oath of
                        another man," said
                        Dunstan when they parted; "as you observe yours, so be your
                        speed, my son."
            </p>
            <p>
                Indisposition, languor, and melancholy, were alike forgotten by Edward, when, with a gallant train of nobles and gentles, attended by jolly hunters
                    and falconers, with hawks and hounds, he left
                    London to follow the sylvan sports in the fair wolds and vales of Dorsetshire.
            </p>
            <p>
                They set forth with merry
                    blasts of horns, baying of hounds, prancing of steeds, waving of
                    plumes and broidered scarfs and mantles, jingling of falcon bells and blithsome
                    caroling of jocund voices, so that all who met them paused to admire their goodly array and sprightly cheer; but Dunstan
                    beheld the departure of his royal
                    charge with a sort of prophetic fear
                    which he could neither repress nor hide.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Thou goest, Edward," said he, when he bestowed his parting blessing upon him&#x97;"thou goest like a foolish bird from beneath its mother's wing ere
                        it be fully
                        fledged for flight; God grant that thou escape the jaws of the serpent that are even now
                        expanded to devour thee."
            </p>
            <p>
                Edward
                    was
                    touched, and indeed surprised, at the pathetic tenderness of his stern preceptor's solemn farewell; for Dunstan
                    was an austere man, who, generally
                    speaking, appeared
                    dead to all human affections, and insensible to the softer emotions of the human heart. Yet now he folded the young king in his arms, and wept over him like a mother over the child
                    of her bosom, who is about to be torn from her for ever.
            </p>
            <p>
                Edward's purpose was
                    shaken, and for a moment he felt
                    disposed to forego his long-wished and
                        eagerly
                    anticipated journey, but the
                    temptation was too strong to be thus easily
                    resigned.
                It is a difficult matter for young people, especially princes, to know who are their
                    real friends.
                The young king, who had always been
                    accustomed in his childhood to receive
                    deceitful flattery and caresses from
                        Elfrida, could not prevail upon himself, notwithstanding her treasonable attempts to supplant him in the succession, to regard her as a personal enemy.
                He knew her to be
                    ambitious, but he could not believe
                    that she was
                    wicked; on the contrary, he excused her conspiring to exclude him from the
                    throne on the plea of her natural preference for her own son, and he secretly
                    considered
                    Dunstan's opinions respecting her as harsh and injurious,
                    although he had never ventured in direct terms to tell him so.
                The archbishop, though tenderly
                    attached to his pupil, and labouring
                    incessantly to promote his interest, was of too stern and unbending a character to study to please him.
                He had a plain and uncompromising manner of reproving
                    his faults and telling him unwelcome truths, which had the effect of wounding his self-love and offending his pride.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a correct observation, that people will sooner forgive a serious injury than overlook an affront, and Edward, although his step-mother
                        had
                    endeavoured to deprive him of a throne, was
                    inclined to regard her more in the light of a friend than the man who had
                    successfully
                    vindicated his rights, and watched day and night for his weal.
                But then, Elfrida
                    had
                    flattered his foibles, and during his
                    father's life had
                    procured him a thousand improper indulgences; while Dunstan
                    controled his inclinations wherever he considered it for his interest so to do,
                    and subjected him to the restraints of a useful and virtuous education.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was with feelings of the deepest regret
                    that this faithful guardian consented to the departure of his royal pupil, especially as he
                        considered it incompatible with his sacred calling, venerable age, and high vocation, to accompany the court on a hunting
                    party.
                To the best of his power he provided against
                    any imprudence on the part of the young king, by surrounding his person with a sufficient number of grave and incorruptible counsellors, whose wisdom and authority he hoped would restrain the vivacity and rash daring of that gay company.
            </p>
            <p>
                The impression of his guardian's solemn warning and unwonted
                    tears at parting, remained for some days on the mind of the young king, and strengthened his resolution of doing nothing in direct violation of his promise,
                    though he continued to indulge a secret hope that some lucky
                    chance might afford him the pleasure of an
                    interview with Prince Ethelred and the Queen,
                    for he certainly
                    cherished a desire of seeing the guileful
                    Elfrida as well as her son.
                Wareham Chase was
                    only six miles distant from Corfe
                    Castle, and, contrary to the advice of the sage monitors to whom the archbishop had
                    delegated his trust, he continued to follow
                    the game in that vicinity.
            </p>
            <p>
                One day, when he had, as much by design as
                    accident, outridden his train in pursuit of a
                    white doe of peculiar beauty and
                    fleetness, he perceived through a forest vista
                    the towers of Corfe Castle rising in the
                    distance, over wood and vale, like the gray crown of the richly-varied landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
                At that sight a thousand sweet and pleasant remembrances of his early
                    days, connected with that beloved spot, rushed to the mind of the young king, and filled his eyes
                    with tears. The boisterous excitement
                    of the chase was
                    forgotten, and dropping his silken bridle on the neck of his gallant gray, he gave himself up to
                        pensive and regretful feelings on the subject of its being
                    denied him to revisit the home of his childhood.
            </p>
            <p>
                "And thou, my fair-haired brother," said he,
                        "who art now, perchance, tossing the ball in the castle court, or chasing the butterfly from flower to
                        flower over the garden lawns and gay parterres, in the thoughtless glee of thine happy age, thou thinkest not, I ween, that the fond
                        brother in whose bosom thou wert
                        wont so oft to nestle when tired with playful
                        gambols, is so near, if indeed thou dost still remember him."
            </p>
            <p>
                While the young king was still indulging
                    in these thoughts, a strange sharp
                    cry near him caused him to look round, when, to his surprise, a grotesque
                    little creature, that appeared neither like a child nor an animal, but
                    something between both, sprang out of a
                    thicket near him, and coiling itself up in
                    the form of a ball, rolled down the hill
                    before him.
                Edward's curiosity was
                    excited, and he spurred his horse forward to overtake it, but when the creature perceived his intention, he bounded up, and erecting himself to
                    his full height, which did not appear to be above two feet, he whirled his long lean arms aloft, and clapping his hands above his head, uttered a cry so long and shrill that it pierced the king's ears with a painful sensation, and was
                    answered back by a thousand echoes from grot
                    and hill, in the deep solitude of Wareham forest.
                The tales of malign faries and woodland imps was then in common belief, and the young king thought it possible that this singular creature, whom he had thus
                        unexpectedly
                    encountered, might be one of these mysterious beings of whom he had
                    heard so much.
                But then he had also a shadowy
                    remembrance of having
                    seen in his early childhood a sprightly animal that bore a grotesque resemblance, both in form and face, to a diminutive man,
                    which played a thousand antic tricks, and was
                    greatly
                    caressed by the queen and her ladies; but it
                        had either been stolen or made
                    its escape from the palace of Corfe in the neighbouring woods; and though a
                    period of nine or ten years had elapsed
                    since this event, King Edward
                    was
                    simple enough to believe that this was the veritable creature
                    whose loss had
                    been so deeply
                    lamented by all the pages and females of the
                    royal household, and he determined to overtake it, if possible, whether it were monkey, fairy, or imp.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the object of his pursuit, however diminutive in person, was more than
                    a match in swiftness of foot for the fleet hunter on which the king was
                    mounted, and, like the goblin page in Sir
                    Walter Scott's Lay of the Last Minstrel, where Edward "rode one mile he ran four, yet with provoking subtlety he continued always to keep in sight, as if he enjoyed the race and wished to continue it.
                Sometimes, when he had
                    climbed a hill, whose steep rugged ascent was
                    scaled with difficulty by the royal steed, he
                        paused on the brow, laughing with malicious glee, and swinging
                    himself from bough to bough among the embowering trees, till the king was nearly upon him, then darting forward with the speed of an arrow, he resumed his flight, and in a few minutes distanced his pursuer.
                Sometimes, when Edward
                    thought he had entirely lost all trace of the
                        tantalizing elf, and was
                    meditating how he should
                    recover the track from which he had so widely
                    deviated, he heard the same sharp shrill cry that had first announced his appearance
                    close to his ear, and perceived a round rough
                    head, covered with shaggy brown locks of
                    tangled hair, through which peered a pair of
                    small keen black eyes, peeping amidst the
                    foliage or clustering ivy of some gnarled
                    oak that wreathed its low fantastic arms
                    across the path, from which, as soon as he perceived he was
                    observed, he leaped with a sudden bound, and clapping his hands and shouting at
                    the top of his voice, started away again down
                    some opening glade of the forest, leaving
                    horse and rider far behind.
                Both were now thoroughly hot and weary ; the
                        young king, who had
                    been on horseback ever since daybreak, and
                        fasting withal, thought of giving up
                    this unprofitable chase as a matter of necessity, on account of the jaded
                    condition of his good steed, and his own fatigue and faintness.
                But the object of his pursuit appeared in still
                    worse plight, limped as if lame, and sometimes
                        rested on the green turf as if thoroughly
                    exhausted
                    weeping and uttering low moaning plaints, and King
                        Edward
                    thought he was now secure of his prize, especially as they had
                    reached the farthest boundary of the forest,
                    and were on the verge of an open park,
                    towards which the urchin began to creep on all fours, occasionally
                    rolling himself over and over at a great
                    rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This," thought the young king, "is his last effort,
                        and I presently
                        shall
                        overtake him on the plain when once he
                            loses the vantage of the underwood and
                        thickets;" and lest he should
                    alarm him into plunging amidst its tangled mazes once more, he followed him at a cautious distance till he emerged from the forest shades, and proceeded at a gentle pace across the park,
                    the enclosure of which they had
                    entered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Edward
                    had
                    been
                    led on from glade to glade through the green
                    mead, in his eager
                    pursuit of the wily urchin, without pausing to examine the scenery
                    through which he rode, or he might possibly
                    have
                    recognized many objects familiar to him in
                    days long past; nor was it till he had
                    leaped the enclosure of the park, and looked around, that he discovered he was in
                    the immediate vicinity, almost at the gates of Corfe Castle, which rose before him in all its well remembered regal grandeur, as in the days when
                    his father, King Edgar, kept court there.
                The intermediate time, the important events that had since befallen the youthful monarch, the solemn warning of his guardian
                    against his venturing near this much loved abode of his childhood, and
                    his own promise not to do so, were alike forgotten by King
                        Edward when he found himself so
                        unexpectedly on the spot to which he
                        had, in fact, been artfully lured
                    by Wulstan, the queen's dwarf, the misshapen little elf, who had
                    led him such a weary chase through the forest,
                    and now, uttering an impish yell, fled down the broad avenue of oaks that led to the castle with the speed of a
                    lapwing, and seizing the bugle that hung at the portal, blew a blast that drew all the inhabitants to the windows and balconies, to learn the meaning of the summons.
            </p>
            <p>
                The king, perceiving that it would now be impossible for him to withdraw unobserved, considered that it would
                    have a very mean appearance, if, after having
                    been
                    seen on the demesne of Queen Elfrida, he retreated without paying his respects to her; and by no means regretting that the rules of courtesy would
                    afford an excuse to himself for departing from a promise which had
                    been so reluctantly
                    wrung from him, he advanced towards the castle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The queen, who was
                    perfectly
                    aware of his approach, hastened to the gates to receive him, and offering him the
                    homage of her knee, entreated him "to enter and
                            partake of the banquet which she had
                        prepared in anticipation of this visit, on
                            hearing that he was
                        hunting the deer in the neighbouring
                        forest of Wareham."
            </p>
            <p>
                Notwithstanding the fascinating
                    sweetness of the queen's address, and
                    the persuasive
                    softness of her voice and language,
                    there was an expression lurking in the sidelong glance of her large blue eye,
                    and sometimes in the deceitful
                    blandishment of her voice and manner,
                    that, in spite of his partial opinion of her character, recalled the archbishop's impressive warning, and gave the king an idea that she meditated some sinister design.
            </p>
            <p>
                This secret misgiving induced him to decline
                    entering the castle, "on account," he said, "of the lateness
                        of the hour, and the expediency of his returning
                        immediately to Wareham, lest his
                        court should
                        take the alarm at his protracted
                        absence."
            </p>
            <p>
                
                    "Thou art
                        hot and weary, my royal lord," replied the queen,
                            respectfully
                        kissing the hand of the youthful monarch, "and thou wilt not surely
                        depart till thou hast, at least, tasted a cup of spiced hippocras, if thou will not feast with me to-day."
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Edward
                    was not willing to offend the queen by declining this offer, especially as he was
                    fatigued, and stood in need of refreshment, and was, moreover, too much inclined to
                        linger near the much-loved abode of his childhood ; and while Elfrida
                    took the silver goblet from her bower maiden,
                    who stood
                    holding it on a richly chased salver, he eagerly
                    inquired for his young brother.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                    "Thy servant, Ethelred, is
                        sick within the castle, or he had
                        come with me to the gate to offer homage to his lord," replied the queen. "He hath
                        long
                        pined for thy presence, like a plant that
                            hath
                        been
                        deprived of sunshine."
                
            </p>
            <p>
                
                    "Send
                        quickly, my lady mother, and fetch him hither," exclaimed the king: "I also have
                        panted to embrace him."
                
            </p>

                "Drink
                            haelThe Saxon phrase for drinking health, from which expression
                            that once general custom was derived, which means, "Wish health," or "I
                            wish your health." first, my gracious lord," 
                    replied
                    Elfrida, presenting the cup to the king.
            </p>
            <p>
                He received it with a smile, and bowing
                    courteously to the queen, repeated the accustomed salutation of "Waes hael," and raised it to his lips, but the same moment he felt the stab of an assassin's dagger from behind.
                He dropped the fatal goblet from his hand, and cast a look of keen but silent reproach on his perfidious step-mother; but ere he
                        could
                    recover his bridle reign, to turn his steed for flight, the deadly thrust was
                    repeated, and his treacherous assailants closed about him to prevent his
                    escape.
            </p>
            <p>
                Indignation at the deep-laid iniquity of the snare into which he had
                    suffered himself to fall thus easily, rendered the young king insensible for a moment to the smart of his wounds;
                    but fully
                    aware of the desperation of his situation,
                    he struck the rowels into the side of his
                    mettled gray, and the good steed as if equally conscious of his master's peril, with one gallant bound broke through the murderous circle, and dashed across the plain with the speed of an arrow just
                        discharged from the bow, and presently
                    distanced the pursuit of the traitors, who continued to trace the course the wounded
                    king had
                    taken by the red life-drops that tracked his path through the forest.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last sound that fell on Edward's ear was the piercing cry of a
                    child in mingled grief and terror, it was the voice of his brother Ethelred, who, on beholding the
                        barbarous deed from a window of
                    the castle, filled the air with his shrieks
                    and lamentations. The assurances of his guilty mother, that it was for his
                    sake, and to make him a king, that the crime
                        had
                    been
                    perpetrated, instead of consoling him, increased his distress to such a passionate degree, that the queen, who considered that his tears a reproach to herself, becoming
                    infuriated at what she styled his unseasonable sorrow, threw herself upon him, and beat him in so violent a manner"With a wax altar-taper;" say the
                        Saxon chroniclers that being the first weapon that fell in the way of this
                        furious and unreasonable woman. that it was for some time a matter of doubt to those about her
                    whether she had not slain her own son in the ungovernable
                    transport of her rage,&#x97;that son, for whose
                    advancement she had the moment previous caused so deadly a crime to be perpetrated in
                    her very presence.

            <p>
                The unfortunate Edward meantime, though he had
                    succeeded in outstripping the pursuit of his ruthless enemies, was
                    sensible of the approach of a foe whom he could neither resist nor flee from.
                Life ebbed apace from the unstanched wounds,
                    the landscape reeled in confusion before his
                        swimming eyes, he struggled with the deadly faintness that was
                    stealing over him, and laboured to rally his
                        failing powers; but the hand of death was
                    heavy at his heart; the reigns dropped from his relaxing grasp, and he fell from the saddle to the ground.

            <p>
                It is
                    related that his foot unfortunately
                    catching in the stirrup, the body of the
                    king, whether dead or living
                    is not exactly
                    known, was
                    much mangled, in consequence of being
                    dragged at a rapid rate along the ground by
                    the terrified horse, which at length stopped
                    of his own accord, at the gate of a blind woman's cottage.
                This lonely woman, notwithstanding the
                    deprivation of sight under which she laboured,
                        ascertained that some fatal accident had
                    befallen the unfortunate youth, and though ignorant of his rank, she humanely
                    carried the bleeding body into her humble dwelling, and laid it on her own bed, while she hastened to procure assistance.
                The wicked
                    Elfrida, whose emissaries had
                    tracked the horse to this place, sought to conceal her crime by causing the
                    corpse of the murdered king to be
                    thrown down a deep well; but there, in
                    consequence of the evidence of the blind widow, it was
                    presently
                    discovered by his sorrowful friends, and her guilt was
                    proclaimed to the whole world, by the indignant
                    Archbishop Dunstan, at the coronation of
                    her son Ethelred, and he then predicted that a crown so obtained
                    could never prosper with the descendants of this bad woman.
            </p>
            <p>
                The high rank of the queen protected her from
                    the punishment due to her crime; but she was
                    regarded with hatred and contempt by all
                    mankind; and feeling herself an object of
                    horror to her own son, for whose advancement she had
                    perpetrated this barbarous deed, and above all, tormented by the fearful stings of her own accusing conscience, she retired to the gloomy shades of a convent, where she spent the residue of her days, vainly
                    endeavouring, by constant penances and
                    fasts, to expiate her crime.

            <h1>Historical Summary</h1>
            <p>When Edward, the eldest son of Edgar the Peaceable, succeeded to his father's
                    throne, under the guardianship, or regency, of Archbishop Dunstan, his dominions
                        were exceeding prosperous ; besides
                    swaying the sceptre of the united Saxon heptarchy, he was bretwalda, or emperor over the whole island of
                    Great Britian, the kings of Scotland and Wales paying him vassal homage for
                    their several domains; in short, he held the same rule that Edward Plantagenet
                    the First afterwards endeavoured to obtain, and succeeded only in regard to Wales.
                The united wisdom of Edgar the Peaceable and his prime minister, Dunstan,
                    established the English sceptre in peace and prosperity.
                During his reign the native Danes were kept
                    in bounds, and the invading ones repelled. This desirable order of things was entirely subverted by the crime of
                    Elfrida, the stepmother of King Edward; for, during the weak reign of her son
                    and pupil, Ethelred, the Danes obtained the mastery of England, and
                    inexpressible miseries ensued to the country, which Had a pause when Edward the
                    Confessor succeeded to the throne, and were
                    afterwards renewed, with tenfold horror, by the invasion of another set of
                    Northmen, under William the Conqueror.
                The whole of this wretchedness may be traced to the personal wickedness of one
                    woman.</p>
            <p>Elfrida was the only child of the Earl of Devonshire, and was considered the greatest beauty and the
                    richest heiress in England.
                The king, Edgar, who was then a widower,
                    having lost his wife, Elfleda the Fair, the mother of his eldest son, Edward,
                    thought that the heiress of Devonshire was
                    worthy to be his consort; but, as she had
                    been brought up in great retirement, and
                    Edgar required beauty and grace in a queen, as well as riches, he thought that
                    report might have exaggerated these qualities in Elfrida, and sent Ethelwold,
                    his favourite, to visit Elfrida, and give him a true account of her claims to
                    personal beauty.
                Ethelwold went accordingly, and found the young lady so charming that he fell in
                    love with her, and wooed her for himself instead of his master, to whom he gave
                    a false testimony, declaring that Elfrida had no charms but in her rich inheritance. Edgar immediately
                    relinquished the design of marrying her, and his favourite observed, that
                    although Elfrida was not qualified to be the
                    wife of a great king, she was a wealthy
                    match, and he should, if the king would permit him, marry her himself
                    forthwith.
                King Edgar consented, and Ethelwold soon after wedded the fair heiress, who,
                    being unconscious of the greater honour intended her, thought she had made a good match.
                In a little time the fair wife of Ethelwold began to be malcontent at finding
                    that her husband kept her mewed up at her own castle, instead of bringing her to
                    the capital, to share in the festivities of the most splendid court in
                    Europe.
                At last a report reached Edgar's ears that he had
                    been deceived, and after vainly questioning
                    his favourite, why he never brought his bride to court, the king announced his
                    intention of paying a visit to Ethelwold and his wife.
                Terrified at this information, Ethelwold went to his lady and confessed his
                    deception, imploring her to appear as ugly and awkward as she could, and rather
                    strive to disgust the king than otherwise; for if she seemed as lovely as nature
                        had made her, the king would never
                    forgive him the false witness he had
                    borne.
                Elfrida promised all things, and as her husband thought he had her heart, he was a little calmed. Nevertheless, both the vanity and ambition of
                    Elfrida being mortified, she was enraged at
                    losing a crown, and still more so at having been so misrepresented.
                She did her utmost to charm King Edgar, who was enfuriated at the falsehood of Ethelwold.
                The unfortunate husband was soon after found
                    murdered in a wood, when on a hunting party.
                Whether he was assassinated by the order of
                    the king, or his wife, was never clearly
                    understood ; but soon after Edgar made Elfrida his queen, and she became the
                    mother of his youngest boy, Ethelred, who was seven years old when his father died.</p>
            <p>At the death of Edgar the councils of the kingdom were divided into Dunstanites and Anti-Dunstanites.
                The partisans of Dunstan were the advocates
                    of church government, as dependent on the pope; these supported the claims of Edgar's eldest son, Edward, and
                    the opposite party set up those of Ethelred, the son of Elfrida.
                Between Dunstan and the queen the most implacable hatred subsisted, which was not abated when that great prelate and
                    minister carried his point, and established his pupil and ward on the throne,
                    which it is to be noticed, although
                    hereditary in one family, was not confined
                    to the eldest son, being rather elective in the royal family. Elfrida retired to
                    the royal domain of Corfe Castle, and privately meditated mischief, which, owing
                    to the vigorous government of Archbishop Dunstan, and his power with the
                    Witenagemot, she was not, for three years
                    able to carry into effect.</p>
            <p>It is here desirable to inform the youthful
                    reader the meaning of the word Witenagemot, more than once mentioned in this
                    tale.
                The Saxon word Witenagemot signifies a "Meeting of the Wise."
                It was the name of the grand legislative
                    assembly of the Anglo-Saxon empire, bearing some resemblance to the parliaments
                    of the present day.
                It was originally composed of five estates,
                    or ranks of men.
                The king was the first estate, and the head
                    of the assembly.
                Next to him sat the clergy, which were
                    bishops, abbots, and priests and monks, elected for their superior abilities
                    from different dioceses; the clergy being the only learned men in the kingdom, and as knowledge is more powerful than strength, they took
                    precedence of the nobles and warriors, and sat next the king: the clergy ranked
                    as the second estate.
                The great earls, or heads of counties, then called aldermen, sat with the
                    tributary princes of Scotland and Wales, with whom they ranked equally, and,
                    like them, wore gold collars and caps of maintenance: these were the nobles, and were reckoned the third estate.
                They filled the station of the present house of lords, only they are mixed with the clergy, as our house of
                    peers has bishops, or spiritual lords, among its members.
                The fourth estate was composed of thanes, or
                    warriors, but, as well as warriors, they were obliged to be landowners.
                An East Anglian (or Norfolk and Suffolk thane) was obliged to possess forty hydes of land to enable him to sit in the
                    Witan: but a thane from Wessex, or the south of England, only needed to possess five hydes (a hyde of land is one hundred acres).
                This fourth estate is similar to our knights
                    of the shire, or members returned for counties.
                The fifth estate were farmers and tradesmen,
                    called in the Saxon language churls and burgesses, or burghers; they stood at
                    the lower end of the hall, and when a law or doom was passed, seldom said more than yea, yea, or nay, nay; these were elected by their neighbours from every town and
                    village, four good men and the reeve, or manager of the parish money, from
                    each.
                It is plainly to be seen that the fourth and
                    fifth estate of the Witenagemot, united together, were the origin of our house of commons; but a century
                    after the Norman Conquest, they turned out the farmers and peasants, and only kept the burgesses, or
                    representatives of towns and cities. It is
                    likewise to be noted, that the Witenagemot was held in one great hall, or on a heath or common, while the house of
                    lords and the house of commons, in our days, sit in council in different halls,
                    excepting they meet together when the king convenes or dismisses them.</p>
            <p>Tradition says, that the Witan existed before the Saxons or Romans conquered
                    Britain, and was held by our British
                    ancestors at Stonehenge, that surprising circle of masses of stone which is still to be seen in the midst of
                    Salisbury Plain.
                In the times of our Saxon ancestors, when a law passed in the Witan it was called a doom, instead of our modern
                    phrase of act of parliament, or a statute.</p>
            <p>In our days the kingdom of Sweden, which was
                    partly the mother country of the Anglo Saxons, still retains the grand national
                    tribunal of the five estates, and the last (the peasants) are a grave, venerable
                    body, men of few words, but of great respectability, and not without power in
                    the commonwealth.</p>
            <p>It was the great council of the Witenagemot
                    that confirmed the title of young Edward, and placed him under the tutelage and
                    guardianship of Archbishop Dunstan, who was
                    a most austere man, deserving the reprobation of posterity as a fanatic and
                    persecutor; but during the short reign of Edward, and the long one of Edgar his
                    father, he was a great statesman, and most
                    able prime minister over a happy people and a flourishing country.
                Elfrida and her partisans were kept in awe by
                    his vigorous administration; but that which public rebellion dared not attempt,
                    accident and private malice effected. Edward and Ethelred, though their several
                    parties might strive to render them enemies, were united by strong ties of brotherly affection.
                Edward chose to hunt the deer at Wareham, in the neighbourhood of Corfe Castle,
                    in Dorsetshire, where Elfrida and Ethelred then resided.
                It is
                    said that with youthful curiosity he was purposely allured to the castle by the
                    tricks of Wulstan, the queen's little cankered dwarf, and he advanced alone to
                    the lofty hall of his mother-in-law.
                She received him at the doorway, and kissed him.
                Before the king alighted, a cup was offered,
                    and as he was quaffing the draught, one of
                    Elfrida's attendants (some say herself) stabbed him.
                The wounded prince had yet strength enough to spur his horse, but fainting on the
                    road, his body was dragged in the stirrup by
                    the affrighted animal, who stopped at the cottage of a blind widow.
                Life was then extinct in the young king,
                    whose bloody corpse was frightfully mangled
                    by the rough road over which he had
                    been hurried.
                Elfrida thus gained her wicked ends, for Ethelred, the younger son of Edgar, was then sole heir.
                So little did the boy exult in his mother's successful crime, that, when told of
                    his brother's dreadful death, he wept most bitterly; this conduct enraged his
                    violent mother to that degree, that she seized a wax taper and so belaboured her
                    child with it that she almost killed him.
                This vile woman became afterwards abjectedly penitent; she built a convent on the
                    spot where Edward's body was found, and
                    ended her life in childish penances; among others, history records that her
                    terror of the supposed approach of the evil one was so great, that she sought to evade his clutch by covering her body
                    all over with little crosses.
                She died in extreme horror.</p>
            <p>There are two terms that require explanation in this tale, the expressions Drink
                    heal and Weas heal.
                They were the forerunners of a custom not
                    entirely obselete among us, and simply meant an invitation to drink one's
                    health, and the answer before drinking of "Wish health."
                A little after this time, when the lawless Danes filled the land with violence
                    and treachery, and actions similar to this murder of Elfrida's became of daily
                    occurrence in the land, the custom of pledging a companion when drinking was usual; and the phrase of "I pledge
                    you," still in use in country places, meant originally, Your honour is pledged not to stab me while the cup is at my lips.</p>
            <p>Ethelred, who seems to have had, naturally,
                    kindly feelings, being brought up under the misrule of his violent, capricious
                    mother, proved a weak and bad king, and his misgovernment laid the foundation of
                    nearly three centuries of misery to his country, which might have been averted, if his brother Edward, a prince of great
                    promise, and assisted by able ministers, had
                    not been cut off by the murderous
                    Elfrida.</p>
