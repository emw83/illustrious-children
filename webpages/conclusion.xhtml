        <p>In examining the bar charts, we can see that while each tale shares many adjectives with the others, there are also many that are unique to each story. We can also look at these adjectives in comparison to each other, to see if they have any commonalities. For example, the two most frequently used adjectives in Guthred are “great” and “royal,” which both indicate strength. We might consider these adjectives as more “masculine,” which is fitting because the main character of Guthred is a young male who becomes king. Lucy, on the other hand, has a greater frequency of traditionally feminine adjectives, such as “little” and “dear.” This indicates that there is a definite correlation between the genders of the characters and the language used to describe them.</p>
