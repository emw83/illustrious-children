            <h1>About Our Project</h1>
            <p>This project focuses on the relationship between langauge and characters in Agnes
                Strickland's children's novel, <i>Historical Tales of Illustrious British
                    Children</i>. Originally published in 1833, <i>Illustrious Childen</i> is a
                collection of short stories, each featuring a prominent figure and event throughout
                British History. The novel aims to merge history and fiction, creating a new,
                entertaining examination of the past to make history more accessible and relatable
                to children.</p>
            <p>One of seven siblings, Agnes Strickland was born in 1796 and educated by her father
                as if she were a boy. Along with her five sisters, and especially her older sister,
                Elizabeth, Strickland did much historical research and writing for children and
                adults. Unlike most historians of the time, Strickland focused mainly on females and
                social issues, including dress, manners, and diet. Strickland wrote several
                biographies on important female figures, as well as a great number of children's
                books, the most notable of which is <i>The Rival Crusoes</i>, published in 1826,
                which borrows the plot from <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> in an attempt to compile classic
                literature into a single cheap, easy to read volume meant for a younger audience. It
                is in this vein that Strickland wrote <i>Illustrious Children</i>, in an attempt to
                fictionalize history in a familar form for young readers who could engage in the
                past outside of a traditional classroom setting.</p>
            <p><i>Historical Tales of Illustrious British Children</i> has an interesting publishing
                history. While it was originally published in 1833 in London, Stricklandâ€™s book
                enjoyed many reprints spanning over the second half of the nineteenth century, both
                in England and in the United States. Jarrold and Sons, the first publisher of the
                book, also put out other notable works from children's fiction, such as <i>Black
                    Beauty</i> (1877). <i>Illustrious Children</i>, as well as many of Strickland's
                other works, were well-circulated throughout the UK, with a number of editions put
                out each year. What is surprising, however, is the fact that it was also published
                several times in the United States, despite the content being rooted in British
                figures and events. The publishing history of <i>Illustrious Children</i> indicates
                that this book was not only well-received, but that it was considered a valuable
                method of teaching history in a global context. Circulation of <i>Historical Tales
                    of Illustrious British Children</i> unfortunately faded out in the twentieth
                century, perhaps to make way for new teaching methods and practices. The work on
                this project is one small effort to bring an unusual and intriguing work out of the
                mist and back into the canon.</p>
            <p>Our project concentrates in particular on five different tales ranging between
                different time periods, ages of characters, and male- and female-oriented stories.
                Our research seeks to unearth what the analysis of language and speech can reveal
                about the relationship betwen male and female characters. Do stories featuring a
                female main character rely more heavily on traditionallly "feminine" adjectives such
                as "dear" or "sweet"? Do male-focused stories use "stronger" wordchoice such as
                "great" and "royal"? Our markup and data aim to classify and highlight these
                differences.</p>
