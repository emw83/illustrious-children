        <p>This project focuses on the relationship between langauge and characters in Agnes
            Strickland's children's novel, <i>Historical Tales of Illustrious British Children</i>.
            Originally published in 1833, <i>Illustrious Childen</i> fictionalizes real events and
            people throughout British history. The book was intended to make history more accessible
            to children by engaging them with tales of the past outside of a traditional classroom
            setting. Strickland's work on historical fiction circulated widely throughout Britain in
            the 19th Century, and several editions were even published in the United States, despite
            the British-centric content. With the turn of the 20th Century, however, <i>Illustrious
                Children</i> has since faded into the relative uknown. The work on this project is
            one small effort to bring an unusual and intriguing work out of the mist and back into
            the canon.</p>
        <p>Our project concentrates in particular on five different tales ranging between different
            time periods, ages of characters, and male- and female-oriented stories. Our research
            seeks to unearth what the analysis of language and speech can reveal about the
            relationship betwen male and female characters. Do stories featuring a female main
            character rely more heavily on traditionallly "feminine" adjectives such as "dear" or
            "sweet"? Do male-focused stories use "stronger" wordchoice such as "great" and "royal"?
            Our markup and data aim to classify and highlight these differences.</p>
