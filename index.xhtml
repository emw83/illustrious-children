        <h1>Illustrious Children</h1>
        <p>Historical Tales of Illustrious British Children by Agnes Strickland takes historical
            events and turns them into fiction. This project, developed as part of the
            Digital Humanities course at the University of Pittsburgh, will examine the relationship
            between male and female characters and historical accuracy through the analysis of
            language and speech.</p>
