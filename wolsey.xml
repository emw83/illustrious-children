                        subtype="linking">could</w> never give a hungry man his dinner, than of all
                    the sensible sights he might see by the way."</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>"Every one to his vocation, master," replied Joan Wolsey; "</q>yours it is to feed
                the bodies, and my Thomas's will <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">be</w> to nourish
                the minds of men with a more enduring food than that which you have it in your power
                to provide.*'</p>
            <p>
                <q>"Gramercy, mistress!" said the butcher, with a grin; "one <w type="verb"
                        subtype="linking">would</w> think he <w type="verb" subtype="linking"
                        >had</w>
                    <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">been</w> feasting you on some of his improving
                    diet, for you begin to discourse like a doctor."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next day, by peep of dawn, the quartette set forth from St. Nicholas's passage on
                their expedition, on which no one reckoned more than young Wolsey, who, wearing his
                college cap and gown, the latter of which <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w>
                tucked up round his waist, lest its long full skirts <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">should</w> impede his horsemanship, <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> mounted on his father's easy-pacing grey mare. For the
                convenience of riding he <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> accommodated with a
                pair of the old man's boots, which drew up far above his knees, and <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">were</w> wide enough to admit three pair of legs like the
                stripling's slender limbs. He rode cautiously at the head of the cavalcade, taking
                care to keep close to Humphrey, who jogged along very comfortably on the black nag,
                whose mettle, if ever it <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> possessed any, <w
                    type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> tamed by the wear and tear of fifteen years
                of service in the butcher's cart.</p>
            <p>Miles and Peter trudged steadily along with their quarter staffs in their hands,
                relying on their own excellent pedestrianism to reach the ultimate place of their
                destination almost as soon as the horsemen of the party, whose steeds they <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">knew</w>
                <w type="verb" subtype="linking">would</w>
                <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">be</w> sorely jaded before they reached St. Peters,
                Wangford, where their master <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> directed them
                to crave lodging far the night of the monks of Clugni, who there occupied a cell
                dependent on the monastery Of Thetford, which also <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb"
                    >was</w> the parent house of the cell at Reydon.</p>
            <p>The two saucy knaves occasionally exchanged sly glances, and cracked dry jokes on the
                unsuitable array and cautious riding of the young Oxford student, their master's
                son, and the steady jog-trot of Humphrey, who rode quite at his ease on a soft
                sheepskin which supplied the place of a saddle, by being tightly buckled with a
                broad leathern strap under the belly of the black nag, whose quiet temper allowed
                her to <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">be</w> ridden safely without the aid of
                stirrups.</p>
            <p>The sun rose brightly in a soft April sky by the time they reached Woodbridge. Young
                Wolsey <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> now become familiar with the paces
                of the grey mare, and the excitement of the exercise, the beauty of the morning, the
                invigorating freshness of the air, and lovely succession of new and agreeable
                objects, contributing to raise his spirits, he soon began to assume a little more of
                the cavalier, and occasionally used the whip and the spurs, in defiance of all
                Humphrey's prudential cautions. Nature <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> well
                qualified the youthful student, both in form and agility, to play the graceful
                horseman, and before they arrived at Wickham Market, the skill and boldness with
                which he managed his steed <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> a matter of
                surprise to the whole party. At this little town they stopped, and refreshed both
                men and beasts with a substantial breakfast, and then set forward on their journey
                with renewed spirits. Young Wolsey, who <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> a
                purpose of his own to answer, put his father's mare to her speed, and soon left the
                pedestrian Peter, and the hapless nag with its double burden, of Humphrey and Miles,
                far in the rear, regardless of their shouts of <q>"Fair play, master Thomas! fair
                    play!" and "Alack, alack, Sir, have a care of master's mare!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the stripling, who liked not the repeated hints which Humphrey <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">had</w> given him of the propriety and expediency, to say
                nothing of the kindness of giving poor Peter a lift behind him, now they <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">were</w> clear of the houses, <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> determined to ride forward, not wishing the bachelor's
                cap and gown to appear in such close fellowship with the butcher's blue and greasy
                buff of his father's men. Besides, he greatly desired, instead of keeping the
                jog-trot pace that suited their convenience, to gain an hour or two to spend with
                the monks of the Holyrood at Blitheborough, and to examine the antiquities,
                architecture, and localities of that ancient and interesting place, through which
                the route chalked out for him by his father lay; but the elder Wolsey <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">had</w> strictly charged Humphrey in his hearing, <q>"not to
                    permit his young master to delay their journey, by wasting his time and theirs
                    in prating Latin gibberish with the black locusts of Blitheborough" (as he
                    irreverently styled those worthy anchorites), "especially as he did not want to
                    deal with them for sheep, the last he <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w>
                    bought off their walks having proved a very poor bargain."</q></p>
            <p>Now young Wolsey, when he heard this caution, secretly resolved to arrange matters so
                as to enjoy the conference with the monks without either infringing his father's
                directions, or being pestered with the company of his blue-frocked retainers. So,
                without allowing himself time to observe the pastoral Benhall, Kensale, or the
                picturesque village of Yoxford, which <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> then,
                as now, one of the prettiest in Suffolk, or even pausing to bestow more than the
                tribute of a passing glance of interest on Cockfield's Gothic Hall, at that period
                newly built, and rising proudly from its embowering woods, he prest his mare on, and
                though, as well as her, sorely wearied with the unwonted number of miles he <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> traversed, his youthful spirits carried
                him forward with unabated energy, till, on descending the last hill after crossing
                the extensive track of purple heath, known by the name of Blitheborough Sheep-walks,
                that most stately structure, the church of the Holy Trinity, rose before him, not in
                the dilapidated grandeur which even now strikes the eye of the eastward traveller
                with astonishment and delight, as, grey with the mantling lichens, and crumbling
                with the neglect and injuries of revolving centuries, it bursts upon his view,
                amidst surrounding desolation, but in all the magnificence of the monastic ages,
                untouched by time and unimpaired by accident, with the bright sunbeams playing and
                flashing on the many-coloured stains of its wide and lofty windows.</p>
            <p>Young Wolsey checked his horse, and gazed upon this noble edifice with the enthusiasm
                natural to the future founder of colleges and gothic buildings; then slowly, and
                looking often backwards, he proceeded to the cell and chapel of the Holy Rood, which
                indeed was so contiguous to the spot that he <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w>
                able still to enjoy a close view of the new church, as it <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> then called, while he partook of the good cheer which
                the hospitable fraternity produced for his refreshment, and to which the hungry
                stripling did ample justice. As the bells were chiming for vespers, monastic
                etiquette compelled him to accompany the monks to their pretty chapel, for which
                building the traveller <w type="verb" subtype="linking">would</w> now look in vain,
                as its only relics are the crumbling group of broken gray arches, so thickly mantled
                with ivy and crowned with wild flowers, that form such an interesting feature in the
                landscape of the desolated village of Blitheburgh,</p>
            <p>When the evening service <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> concluded, the
                friendly monks gratified their visitor with an interior view of the church of the
                Holy Trinity, and pointed out to him its rich carvings, screens, trellises, and
                magnificently sculptured and emblazoned roof, not forgetting to call his attention
                to the antique tombs which, as tradition reports, once covered the mortal remains of
                Annas, king of the East Angles, and Ferminius, his son, who <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">were</w> slain in a bloody battle with Penda, the pagan king
                of Mercia, which <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> fought in the adjacent
                marshes of Bulcamp, or Baldkemp. From the leads over the south aisle, they made him
                observe the fine sea view of Southwold, Walberswick, and the city of Dunwich, well
                known to him in ecclesiastic history as the ancient metropolitan city of the kingdom
                of the East Angles, where Saxon monarchs kept court in the olden time, and the
                bishop of the two counties held his see, till the resistless waves of the German
                Ocean committed such ravages as compelled the diocesan to remove his episcopal see
                to Thetford, and afterwards buried that time-honoured seat of learning and royalty
                (Dunwich), with its walls and brazen gates, its fifty-two churches and religious
                houses, together with its numerous streets and public buildings, beneath its raging
                waters.</p>
            <p>With a sigh the young student turned from the contemplation of the melancholy wreck
                of ancient splendour, which the fallen city of the East Anglians presented even in
                the sixteenth century, when several churches and numerous vestiges of its former
                greatness still survived the storms of ages and the assaults of the hungry waves;
                but what would he have thought <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> he seen it
                as it now is, reduced to a few ruinous fishermen's huts, and of all its churches and
                religious houses, retaining only the roofless shell of one, in which divine service
                is no longer performed! Doubtless he <w type="verb" subtype="linking">would</w> have
                applied the words of the lamentation pronounced by the prophet over the desolation
                of Tyre: <q>"Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient date? Who hath
                    taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes,
                    whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Young Wolsey <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w>
                <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">been</w> too deeply engaged in the contemplation of
                these interesting localities to embrace the opportunity of displaying his own
                learning to the friendly monks, who <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> treated
                him with the respect which his natural talents and early acquirements <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">were</w> well calculated to inspire, and pressingly invited
                him to sojourn with them during the rest of the evening, and pass the night in their
                dormitory; but the importunities of Humphrey (who, with Peter and Miles, <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> arrived while he <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> at vespers, and having refreshed themselves and the
                black nag, <w type="verb" subtype="linking">were</w> now clamorous to proceed)
                prevailing over his desire of accepting an invitation so agreeable to his own
                inclinations, he took a loving farewell of the hospitable fraternity, promising to
                find some way of gratifying his wish of passing a few hours with them on his return.
                Then mounting the gray mare, he rode forward at a gentle pace with his weary and
                somewhat malcontent companions, who scrupled not to reproach him for the want of
                good fellowship he <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> displayed in deserting
                their company. Nor did Humphrey fail to exert the privilege of an old and trusted
                servant, by rating his young master soundly for having over heated the gray mare on
                a long journey, besides incurring much peril of accidents both to himself and that
                valuable animal, on account of his being an inexperienced rider, and quite
                unacquainted with the road. The young student, who <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb"
                    >was</w> of course rather impatient of these rebukes, which he considered very
                derogatory to the dignity of a bachelor of Oxford to receive from butchers and
                cattle drovers, endeavoured to escape from them by a repetition of his offence,
                namely, outriding the party; but that <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> no
                longer in his power, for he <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> fairly knocked
                up the gray mare, so that she <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> unable to
                compete with the shabby nag on which Humphrey rode, and the only alternative left
                him, <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> to listen meekly, or to turn a deaf
                ear, to the reproaches that assailed him right and left, and amuse himself with his
                own reflections, or in contemplating the charms of the varied landscape before him,
                when, on ascending the gentle hill leading from Blitheburgh, he found himself among
                the rich woods and cowslipped meads of Henham, whose castellated hall, then the
                residence of the Brandons, rose in all its gothic grandeur over grove and vale, as
                the crowning object of the prospect, but <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w>
                soon after hidden behind the intervening screen of deep embowering shades, which <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">were</w> then almost impervious to the light of
                day, and converted the advancing gloom of evening into early night. No sooner <w
                    type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> the party involved in this security, than
                the offended trio, Humphrey, Miles, and Peter, united their chorus of grumbling at
                their detention at Blitheburgh, declaring that they <w type="verb" subtype="linking"
                    >were</w> benighted, and <w type="verb" subtype="linking">should</w> in all
                probability <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">be</w> robbed of the sum entrusted to
                them for the purchase of the cattle.</p>
            <p>The welcome sound of the curfew bell of St. Peter's, Wangford, however, soon informed
                them that their apprehensions <w type="verb" subtype="linking">were</w> groundless,
                and put them into better humour, by advertising them that they <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">were</w> not more than a mile distant from the place of their
                destination, and presently, after emerging from beneath the sombre shadows of
                Henham's oaken glades, they found themselves once more in day light, and in the
                immediate vicinity of the<q>""- pretty village of Wangford, which, with its
                    picturesque monastery and chapel of St. Peter"</q>s, crowning a gentle eminence,
                lay full before them.</p>
            <p>The pastoral rivulet of the Wang, from which the name of this hamlet <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> derived, was soon forded by the weary travellers, who,
                proceeding to the little convent, obtained without difficulty food and shelter for
                the night. The next morning, as soon as matins <w type="verb" subtype="linking"
                    >were</w> over, which service they of course considered themselves bound to
                attend, they set forward on their short journey to the neighbouring monastery of
                Reydon, which, as I said before, <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> a detached
                branch of the cell of St. Peter's, both dependencies on the monastery of
                Thetford.</p>
            <p>Leaving its green bowery labyrinth of sylvan lanes, its antique hall and park, its
                aboriginal forest. and the gray spire of its venerable church, and all that <w
                    type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> pleasing and attractive in the landscape of
                the Reydun, or the red hill (which its Saxon name signifies), to the left, Humphrey
                guided the party through a narrow, wet, and incommodious road, to a mean conventual
                building, situated at the most desolate extremity of the parish, among the salt
                marshes.</p>
            <p>If Wolsey <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> expected to find learning, piety,
                or hospitality among this fraternity, he <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w>
                certainly much disappointed; for a set of more illiterate and narrow-minded men than
                these Reydon monks <w type="verb" subtype="linking">were</w> never congregated
                together. Far from expressing the least interest in the acquirements of their young
                guest, they received the intelligence of his proficiency in the learned languages
                with dismay, and appeared far better pleased with the conversation of Humphrey,
                Peter, and Miles, which indeed <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> more in
                unison with their tastes than that of the scholastic Wolsey, whom they entertained
                with long dissertations, not on the fathers or the classics, but on the most
                profitable breeds of cattle, and the most approved methods of fatting swine, in all
                which matters they <w type="verb" subtype="linking">were</w> very fluent, and
                appeared to consider it passing strange that a butcher's son possessed so little
                knowledge on such interesting topics. They also discussed the best method of curing
                white bacon, as the fat of pickled pork is called in that part of Suffolk. On this
                delectable article Wolsey and his party <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> the
                felicity of supping that evening, which he afterwards declared <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> the dullest he ever spent in the whole course of his
                life.</p>
            <p>The next morning, though the bells chimed for matins, the monks <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">made</w> no movement to enter the chapel, as THEIR matin
                service <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> confined to that ceremony; and when
                Wolsey expressed his surprise at such unorthodox neglect of the prescribed offices
                of holy church, they replied <q>"that it <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w>
                    neither a sabbath nor a festival, and their swine must <w type="verb"
                        subtype="beVerb">be</w> attended to."</q></p>
            <p>When this interesting duty <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w>
                <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">been</w> zealously performed by the fraternity, they
                proceded with their guests to the marshes where their cattle fed, where a long and
                animated discussion took place between Humphrey and the superior of the convent
                respecting the price, the merits, and defects of the beasts which Humphrey deemed
                most worthy of his attention, in which so much time <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb"
                    >was</w> wasted that the dinner bell rung before they <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">had</w> settled the price of so much as one bullock.</p>
            <p>At this meal they <w type="verb" subtype="linking">were</w> again regaled with white
                bacon, which appeared a standing dish in this convent, for it <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> produced at supper, breakfast, and dinner; at the
                latter, indeed, there <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> the addition of a huge
                dish of hard dumplings, with which they devoured a quantity of pork dripping by way
                of sauce.</p>
            <p>The morning <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w>
                <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">been</w> fine but showery, in the afternoon a heavy
                rain set in, which rendered it impossible either to visit the cattle-marshes again,
                or to proceed homewards, which young Wolsey recommended his father's men to do, on
                the conviction of the impossibility cf ever concluding a bargain with these frocked
                and cowled dealers in cattle and feeders of swine.</p>
            <p>The rain, however, continued without intermission, and the malcontent student was
                compelled to remain where he <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> till the
                    <q>"plague of water,"</q> as he called this unwelcome downpouring, <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">should</w> abate.</p>
            <p>How to pass the weary interval with men whose minds and manners <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">were</w> so dissimilar to his own, he <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">knew</w> not. Books they <w type="verb" subtype="linking"
                    >had</w> never a one except their breviaries, and their acquaintance with these
                    <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> a doubtful matter to the young student,
                since no persuasions of his <w type="verb" subtype="linking">could</w> induce them
                to perform vespers when the bells chimed for that service, although it <w
                    type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> a wet afternoon on which nothing else <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">could</w>
                <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">be</w> done.</p>
            <p>Whether to attribute this to their utter disrelish to any thing of a spiritual
                nature, or to their fear of betraying their ignorance in latin and other
                deficiencies to one whom they feared <w type="verb" subtype="linking">would</w>
                detect their blunders, and perhaps report them to their superior at Thetford, Wolsey
                    <w type="verb" subtype="linking">knew</w> not, but he <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> so heartily weary of his sojourn among them, that
                nothing but the most pathetie remonstrances and earnest protestations on the part of
                Humphrey against such a measure, prevented him from retracing his steps to
                Blitheburgh, in spite of the rain, and remaining with the monks of Holy-Rood Chapel
                till his father's people <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> transacted their
                business with the conventual graziers of Reydon.</p>
            <p>The following morning proving fine, they again proceeded to the marshes in the hope
                of striking a bargain^ which <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> at length
                concluded; but not till after a delay that appeared to the impatient Wolsey almost
                interminable, which time he employed, not in listening to the altercations of the
                buyer and sellers of the bullocks, but in strolling through the marshes, and making
                observations, till he obtained a view of Blitheburgh on the line of country that
                intervened, across which he persuaded himself a much shorter cut to that village
                might <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">be</w>
                <w type="verb" subtype="linking">made</w> than by following the usual road through
                Wangford. Just as he <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> come to the resolution
                of attempting that route, the convent bell rang for dinner, and summoned him to a
                sixth meal of white bacon, of which the monks ate with as keen an appetite as if it
                    <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w>
                <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">been</w> the first time they ever partook of that
                savoury fare, of which Wolsey <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> by this time
                almost as weary as of the company of the founders of the entertainment.</p>
            <p>The bullocks, twelve in number, <w type="verb" subtype="linking">were</w> now driven
                into the convent yard, and Humphrey called upon his young master to pay down the
                price for which he and the monks had agreed, at the average sum of one pound ten
                shillings a head, which he pronounced an unconscionable sum with a sly wink of
                intelligence at the Oxford student, by which he gave the youth, who <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> about to take his words literally, to understand that
                he was well satisfied with the bargain. In fact, the Reydon monks, shrewed and
                exacting as they were, <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> met with more than
                their match in the calculating, experienced Humphrey, who, without making a boast of
                his wisdom in this way, <w type="verb" subtype="linking">knew</w> how to judge of
                the weight of a living ox almost to an odd pound. Till the business <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> concluded, the money paid, and the receipt given, he <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> forborne to taste of the convent meed or
                ale, though both <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w>
                <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">been</w> pressed upon him with an earnestness
                passing the bounds either of politeness or hospitality by the cunning monks, who
                hoped to overcome Humprey's cool clear judgment and caution, by means of the merry
                brown bowl; but now all fear of being overreached in his bargain in consequence of
                such an indulgence <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> at an end, Humphrey,
                malgre all his young master's expostulations, demanded the lately rejected beverage,
                of which he, with Miles and Peter drank pretty freely, though not so much as they <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">would</w> have done <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">had</w> the cloistered cattle-dealers <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">been</w> willing to produce more, which they <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">were</w> always sparing in doing after a bargain <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w>
                <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">been</w> definitely struck.</p>
            <p>The draughts which the trio <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> swallowed <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> had, however, the effect of putting them
                all into such good humour, that when Wolsey on mounting proposed to them his plan of
                changing the roundabout route though Wrangford, for a straight cut acroos the
                marshes to Blitheburgh, they offered no objection, for even the prudent Humphrey <w
                    type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> desirous of adopting any expedient by which
                they might make up for the time they <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> lost
                in drinking the convent ale after the business <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb"
                    >was</w> transacted. </p>
            <p>The monks assured them the project <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> feasible,
                since the branch of the Blithe which separated Hentham and Reydon <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> fordable, and they <w type="verb" subtype="linking"
                    >would</w> save a considerable distance by crossing the river, but their
                hospitality did not extend to the civility of sending one of their swineherds or
                goose-boys to point out the precise spot at which the attempt might <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">be</w>
                <w type="verb" subtype="linking">made</w> without danger to passengers. The stream
                    <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> much swollen in consequence of the late
                heavy rains; Humphrey and the drovers paused on the rushy bank, each prudently
                declining to <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">be</w> the first to try the ford.
                Wolsey, who <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> piqued at their doubts of his
                assurance <q>"that it <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> safe! perfectly
                    safe!"</q> though he <w type="verb" subtype="linking">would</w> rather have <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> one of the others show a demonstrable
                proof that there <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> no danger, urged his
                reluctant mare forward.</p>
            <p><q>"Hold, master Thomas, hold! for the love of St. Margaret of Rissmere,"</q> cried
                Humphrey, who <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> suddenly sobered by the sight
                of his young master's peril, and the recollection that the stream <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> deep and muddy.</p>
            <p>Now this St. Margaret of Rissmere <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> a saint for
                whom Wolsey <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> neither love nor reverence, for
                she <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> the patroness of the unlearned monks of
                Reydon; so, without heeding the adjuration so pathetically addressed to him in her
                name, he boldly plunged into the dark and swollen waters of the dangerous ford. He
                was, as we have seen, an inexperienced rider on dry land, but a more skilful
                horseman than the stripling student <w type="verb" subtype="linking">would</w> have
                found it a difficult matter to retain his seat and guide the terrified animal, who
                presently lost her footing, and began to kick in the muddy slippery ooze of which
                the bed of the Blithe and its dependent streams are composed, and which, having
                recently <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">been</w> violently disturbed by the heavy
                rains, <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> in a state of complete ferment and
                liquefaction.</p>
            <p>Wolsey, though encumbered with his bachelors gown, which he <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">had</w> not this time taken the precautionary measure of
                tucking up and fastening to his girdle, courageously maintained his seat till the
                mare, exhausted with her violent efforts, sunk, and left him floating on the stream.
                He <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> an expert swimmer in the clear calm
                Orwell, or the pastoral Gipping, his native streams, but scarcely a fish that had <w
                    type="verb" subtype="beVerb">been</w> used to the fresh sparkling element of
                such rivers as these, <w type="verb" subtype="linking">could</w> have steered its
                course in the dank vortex of brackish mud in which poor Wolsey <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> immersed.</p>
            <p>Peter and Miles stood aghast at the accident, uttering doleful cries for help,
                without venturing to make a single effort to save the almost exhausted youth.
                Humphrey, the faithful Humphrey, at the first alarm <w type="verb" subtype="linking"
                    >had</w> dismounted from the nag, and <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w>
                preparing to plunge into the stream to save his master's son, or perish in the
                attempt, when one of Sir Richard Brandon's wood-rangers, who had seen the accident
                and hastened to the spot, reached the end of the long pole he <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">had</w>
                <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">been</w> using in leaping the marsh ditches to the
                youth, by which assistance, the stream being narrow at that place, he <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> enabled, though not without some difficulty, to gain
                the opposite bank, from which, as soon as he had cleared his eyes and mouth of the
                salt, bitter, and unsavoury ooze he <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w>
                <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">been</w> compelled to swallow, he called out in an
                accent of distress to Humphrey, <q>"Oh! Humphrey, Humphrey! what shall we say to my
                    father about the gray mare?"</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>"St. Margaret of Rissmere take the mare!" sobbed Humphrey, who appeared to
                    consider the patroness of Reydon as somehow chargeable with their mishap; "don't
                    talk of her, my dear boy, when she <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w>
                    nearly <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">been</w> the death of you. Howsomdever,
                    master Thomas, you must never undertake to lead those who are wiser than
                    yourself short cuts any more. I hope you have <w type="verb" subtype="linking"
                        >had</w> enough of this precious ford, that <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb"
                        >was</w> to take you such a near way to Blitheburgh."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>"Why so it will, you simple fellow," said Wolsey," laughing, and wiping the mud
                    from his face, "do not you see the beautiful church over those marshes almost at
                    my elbow? I shall bestir myself to get there as fast as I can, now I am over the
                    water, that I may get dry clothes, a good supper, and some pleasant chat with
                    the worthy monks of the Holy Rood, which will console me for the drenching I
                    have got."</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>"Alack, alack! master Thomas ! what is to become of us and the bullocks?"</q>
                howled Miles and Peter from the opposite bank.</p>
            <p><q>"You may come over the river to me, an you like,"</q> responded Wolsey, from the
                other side.</p>
            <p><q>"We durst not do that for our lives,"</q> cried the trembling drovers.</p>
            <p>
                <q>"Then turn yourselves and the bullocks about, and find the road to Wangford as
                    well as ye can: Humphrey knows the country, and he will guide ye to Blitheburgh
                    by that roundabout way, ye poltroons, unless ye choose to stay where ye are till
                    I am a Cardinal, when it is my intention to build a bridge over this sweet
                    stream, to prevent other travellers from incurring the peril which I have done,
                    in endeavouring to ford such a bottomless abyss of mud."</q>
            </p>
            <p>We will not follow the young bachelor to Blitheburgh, where doubtless he met with
                agreeable entertainment, nor will the limits of our tale admit of our tracing the
                progressive steps by which he in the sequel attained to the eminence to which his
                ambition, even in childhood, prompted him to aspire. By keeping bis attention
                constantly fixed on this object, he found it at last within his reach ; but <w
                    type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> he then contented? Let me answer this query
                with anotherWhen <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> the desire of human
                greatness ever satisfied? I refer the juvenile reader to the historical summary for
                further particulars of the career of this extraordinary man, who, when he <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> attained to the coveted rank of Cardinal,
                though he <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> burdened with the cares of the
                prime minister of England, which office he held during twenty years of Henry the
                Eighth's reign, <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> not forgetful of his promise
                of building a bridge over the stream which <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w>
                so nearly proved fatal to himself. The name of the bridge, and the local tradition
                thereunto belonging, will long, I trust, exist to preserve the memory of an action
                of pure benevolence to future ages.</p>

        <back>Thomas Wolsey <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> the only son of Thomas and Joan
            Wolsey, and <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> born at Ipswich, in August, 1471.
            His father <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> a butcher and grazier. The house in
            which Wolsey <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> born is still shown, and is
            situated in the south side of the passage leading to St. Nicholas' churchyard; and in
            the ancient shambles, or butchery, which lately stood upon the Cornhill, at Ipswich, <w
                type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> a stall, or stand, with the initials of
            Wolsey's father carved thereon, and some other insignia which tradition points out as
            belonging to him. Wolsey's father, though a man of low trade, <w type="verb"
                subtype="beVerb">was</w> in opulent circumstances, and connected with some of the
            most respectable families at Ipswich, either by descent or marriage. His will is
            preserved, wherein it appears that he left his lands to his wife Joan, and the rest of
            his wealth divided between his wife and son, reserving however a handsome bequest to the
            church of St. Nicholas and the poor of the parish. <p>There are floating traditions in
                Suffolk, which intimate that the butcher Wolsey <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb"
                    >was</w> desirous that his son <w type="verb" subtype="linking">should</w>
                follow his own trade, and in pursuance of this plan, he <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">made</w> him assist is driving the beasts he bought at various
                markets for sale and slaughter at Ipswich. In one of these expeditions he nearly
                lost his life, at a dangerous ford at Reydon. over a branch of the river Blythe,
                when driving a number of bullocks which <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w>
                <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">been</w> purchased from Reydon salt marshes and
                South wold common. It is further said, that he promised on the spot, <q>"that if
                    ever he became cardinal, he <w type="verb" subtype="linking">would</w> build a
                    bridge at that dangerous spot."</q> Wolsey kept his word, and when he arrived at
                the high dignity his youthful ambition even then aimed at, he built a bridge at
                Reydon, which is to this day called Wolsey Bridge.</p>
            <p>It is a singular thing, that although forced to join at times the inconsistent
                occupations of a drover and student, that Wolsey <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb"
                    >was</w> admitted as a bachelor of arts at Magdalen College at the age of
                fourteen, from which extraordinary circumstance he was called the Boy Bachelor. It
                must <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">be</w> observed, that students <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">were</w> entered at the universities much earlier in former
                times than is usual at this era; but to take a degree at the age of fourteen, justly
                excited universal astonishment throughout the kingdom, in all men who <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">were</w> devoted to, or interested in, learning; and Wolsey
                was marked as a character likely to rise in the church, which <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> then the only path to high distinction. We must not
                forget to note here, that young Wolsey had <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">been</w>
                as promising at Ipswich school as he <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> as a
                student at Magdalen College; so says Lloyd, one of his biographers. The first step
                to his subsequent greatness in the state <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> his
                appointment to the situation of domestic chaplain to Henry the Seventh, a monarch
                who himself <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> received a conventual
                education, and <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> a discerning patron of
                learned men, knowing well how to appreciate them. There were, as matters stood in
                the middle ages, two roads in the church to great distinction: one was, for a
                leraned priest to practise great austerity and sanctity, so that he <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> considered a saint and revered by all men; and the
                other, tr devote himself regularly to business as a statesman, and govern church and
                state as prime minister, which <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> done in
                England by whoever held the office of lord chancellor. The latter path <w
                    type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> chosen by Wolsey, who <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">had</w> a particular inclination to a court life, and
                declared, that <q>"if he <w type="verb" subtype="linking">could</w> set one foot in
                    the court, he <w type="verb" subtype="linking">would</w> soon introduce his
                    whole body."</q></p>
            <p>The first affair of state in which he <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w>
                concerned, <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> a mission from Henry the Seventh
                to Maximilian, Emperor of Germany, who <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> then
                at Bruges. After receiving his instructions at the royal palace of Shene (now called
                Richmond), where the king then kept court, he set out on his errand. We must
                consider the state of the roads, and the delays of travelling at that time, which <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">were</w> so great that a journey from Ipswich to
                London took at least a week, and even in the memory of man, a day and night <w
                    type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> spent on the road when travelling by a
                stage coach. Therefore, when Wolsey presented himself before Henry the Seventh at
                the end of three days, that monarch naturally supposed that his envoy <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">had</w> not yet set out, but <w type="verb" subtype="linking"
                    >had</w> returned for fresh instructions, and he began to reproach him for his
                dilatoriness, when, to his astonishment, Wolsey declared that he <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">had</w> actually <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">been</w> at
                Bruges, and performed his mission successfully. <q>"Ay," answered the king, "but
                    upon farther deliberation, finding that something <w type="verb"
                        subtype="linking">had</w>
                    <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">been</w> omitted in your instructions, I
                    despatched a messenger after you with fuller powers." To which Wolsey replied,
                    "that he <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> indeed met the messenger on
                    his return, and on communicating with him, found that he <w type="verb"
                        subtype="linking">had</w> anticipated the view that Henry <w type="verb"
                        subtype="linking">had</w> taken of the business, and performed his
                    negociation with the emperor precisely according to Henry's second thoughts of
                    the affair, so that there <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> no need of a
                    second journey."</q> Henry <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> highly
                pleased with his envoy's sagacity and promptitude, and with its favourable issue; he
                gave him public thanks, and declared him in council fit to <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">be</w> entrusted with the management of affairs of the utmost
                importance. He rewarded him with the deanery of Lincoln, and the prebends of Walton,
                Brindhold, and Stow; and to complete his good fortune, his graceful and eloquent
                relation of the particulars of his embassy before the council, attracted the notice
                of the Prince of Wales, afterwards Henry the Eighth, who grew from that time
                extremely fond of his company.</p>
            <p>Such <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> his introduction as a statesman. From
                the first year of the reign of Henry the Eighth, 1509, till 1529, the butcher's son
                ruled England with absolute power, and at the same time with great ability. These
                twenty years <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> the happiest epoch of Henry's
                reign; for, after Wolsey's fall, the sovereign commenced a career of crime, and his
                people of misery. Wolsey filled the high offices of Grand Almoner, Archbishop of
                York, Lord Chancellor, Pope's Legate, and Cardinal. He carried personal splendour
                and state higher than any subject ever did before or since, and <w type="verb"
                    subtype="linking">would</w> most likely have died in possession of all these
                honours, <w type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> he not aimed at the highest then
                in the world, even at the Popedom; but his intrigues to reach this pinnacle of a
                churchman's ambition, lured him to such imprudent steps as caused the downfall of
                his mighty power, and a few weeks after he died of grief at Leicester Abbey.</p>
            <p>The munificent public works executed by Wolsey, both as prime minister and from his
                own private revenue, are greater perhaps than any subject ever performed. He
                reendowed and reformed his own university of Oxford, with such magnificence, that he
                is almost considered as its founder, according to its present state. His love for
                his native county of Suffolk <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> great, and the
                college he built and endowed in his mother town of Ipswich, is a proof that he <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">had</w> the magnanimity not to <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">be</w> ashamed of his origin; but the rapacious tyrant, whose
                caprice caused his downfall, seized upon the revenues and destroyed the infant
                college, of which only one of the gateways remain. But perhaps the most
                extraordinary work in which this great man engaged, was, that he partly wrote and
                wholly revised, Lillye's grammar, a work of such use that it <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">was</w> in general use within the last century. Such <w
                    type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> the love of this mighty statesman for
                learning, that he paused in his career of unbounded power and pomp to smooth the way
                to children for the attainment of knowledge: who, after such an example, need <w
                    type="verb" subtype="beVerb">be</w> ashamed of devoting their talents to writing
                children's books!</p>
            <p>This sketch of Wolsey has not shown the dark side of his character, which <w
                    type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> deformed with many faults, and some crimes.
                Shakspeare has summed up the account of both good and ill, with such skill that
                volumes cannot impress upon the youthful mind a more accurate comprehension of
                Wolsey's character, than that given in the dialogue between Catherine of Arragon,
                Henry the Eighth's divorced queen, and Griffith, her chamberlain.</p>
            <p>CATHERINE.</p>
            <p>Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me, That the great child of honour,
                Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead? Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died.</p>
            <p>GRIFFITH.</p>
            <p>Well, the voice goes, madam; For after the stout Earl Northumberland Arrested him at
                York, and brought him forward (As a man sore tainted), to his answer, He fell sick
                suddenly, and grew so ill, He <w type="verb" subtype="linking">could</w> not sit his
                mule. At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester, Lodg'd in the abbey; where the
                reverend abbot, With all his convent, honourably received him; To whom he gave these
                words," O, father abbot, An old man, broken with the storms of state, Is come to
                lay his weary hones among ye; Give him a little earth for charity!" So went to bed;
                where eagerly his sickness Pursu'd him still; and, three nights after this, About
                the hour of eight (which he himself Foretold should <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb"
                    >be</w> his last), full of repentance, Continual meditations, tears, and
                sorrows, He gave his honours to the world again, His blessed part to heaven, and
                slept in peace.</p>
            <p>CATHERINE.</p>
            <p>So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him! Yet, thus far, Griffith, give me leave
                to speak him And yet with charity ;He <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> a man
                Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking Himself with princes; one, that by suggestion
                Tithed all the kingdom; simony <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> fair play;
                His own opinions <w type="verb" subtype="linking">were</w> his law: I'the presence
                He <w type="verb" subtype="linking">would</w> stay untruths; and <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">be</w> ever double, Both in his words and meaning: He <w
                    type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> never, But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:
                His promises <w type="verb" subtype="linking">were</w> then as <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">be</w> was, mighty; But his performance as he now is, nothing.
                Of his own body he <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> ill, and gave The clergy
                ill example.</p>
            <p>GRIFFITH.</p>
            <p>Noble madam, Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues We write in water. May
                it please your highness To hear me speak his good now?</p>
            <p>CATHERINE.</p>
            <p>Yes. good Griffith I <w type="verb" subtype="linking">were</w> malicious else.</p>
            <p>GRIFFITH.</p>
            <p>This cardinal, Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly Was fashioned to much honour.
                Fom his cradle He <w type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> a scholar, and a ripe and
                good one; Exceeding wise, fair spoken, and persuading: Lofty, and sour, to them who
                lov'd him not; But, to those men that sought him, sweet as summer. And though he <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">were</w> unsatisfied in getting (Which <w
                    type="verb" subtype="linking">were</w> a sin), yet in bestowing, madam, He <w
                    type="verb" subtype="beVerb">was</w> most princely: Ever witness for him Those
                twins of learning, which he raised in you, Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell
                with him, Unwilling to outlive the good he did it; The other, though unfinished, yet
                so famous, So excellent in art, and still so rising, That Christendom shall ever
                speak his virtue. His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him; For then, and not till
                then, he felt himself, And found the blessedness of being little: And, to add
                greater honours to his age Than man <w type="verb" subtype="linking">could</w> give
                him, he died, fearing God.</p>
            <p>CATHERINE.</p>
            <p>After my death I wish no other herald, No other speaker of my living actions, To keep
                my honour from corruption, But such an honest chronicler as Griffith. Whom I most
                hated living, thou hast <w type="verb" subtype="linking">made</w> me, With thy
                religious truth and modesty, Now in his ashes honour. Peace <w type="verb"
                    subtype="beVerb">be</w> with him.</p></back>
